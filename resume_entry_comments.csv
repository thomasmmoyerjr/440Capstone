426,732,3273,0,Monica - it's great that you were able to recognize the importance of learning the strengths/skills of your teammates. In both the collegiate and (especially) the professional world it's essential that you are able to quickly and effectively identify the strengths/weaknesses with those you are working with - whether they be your employees peers or senior to you. Another key is to be able to leverage those insights into making good decisions about team structure communications,,,1
427,725,3273,0,Jordan - time constraints are never fun! You get plenty of practice with individual time management in college but it was nice to see you being in a situation where you all were dependent on each other and had to use your communication and leadership skills to ensure you stayed on track. This is very representative of the working world where you almost always are depending on work from other to complete your tasks or someone is depending on you. Clear communication is crucial.,,,1
428,733,3273,0,"Manuel - good insight about being assertive and owning the interview. You definitely want to be an active participant. Also remember that an interview is just as much about finding out whether the company is a good fit for YOU as it is them finding out if you'll be a good fit for that company. Be prepared do your """"homework"""" on the company and have meaningful intelligent questions that make your interviewer think. Doing so can help show how well you think",,,1

445,1028,3344,0,Grant - Good reflection. As you continue group work throughout the rest of your time at Penn State and in other endeavors consider the positives and negatives of strictly defined roles and goals. Can you think of an experience you have had where you were unable to step out of a defined role that limited you from experiences? Have you ever worked in a group that set goals that were too feasible to start with thereby limiting the groups potential?,,,1
446,899,3344,0,Natalie - Great observations and connections with the activity and plans for SHO Time moving forward. You mentioned that you believe that trust is the most important skill when it comes to making a team effective. How do you feel trust is built effectively within a team? How does the trust you have among a team you work with for a project differ from the trust you have in your friends? Is there a certain level of trust that needs to be reached within a group? If so how is that level determined ;1;,,,1
448,1032,3344,0,Joe - Great job referencing your experiences in your first-year CAS class. You mentioned the organizational meeting your team had towards the end of the project in order to iron out key details that needed to be addressed in order to make progress. How do you create the same kind of pressure artificially 5 weeks before a project is due? What role does getting to know the people with whom you are working serve in that meeting? Would assigning roles too early be detrimental to the creativity of th,,,1
449,979,3344,0,Sneha - Nice job referencing your experience in Engineering Design 100H. You mentioned how you were able get to know and understand the individuals within the group you worked with more over the course over the semester. However the main portion of SHO Time is much more condensed. How would you approach misunderstandings or conflicts between your mentees? How will you allow them the chance to get to learn more about one another.,,,1
450,908,3344,0,Marisa - Thank you for sharing your previous experiences of working in groups. In SHO Time plenty of the work is delegated for the mentors. However there are certainly opportunities to go beyond what is asked of you. How will you balance your contributions to SHO Time while ensuring that you are allotting the appropriate amount of time to your group and to yourself?,,,1
451,899,3344,0,and how might it differ from one group member to another?,,,0
452,867,3344,0,Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that for a student who for one reason or another is unable to attend certain events?,,,1
453,867,3344,0,Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that a student who for one reason or another is unable to attend certain events is still able to get the most out of SHO Time?,,,1
454,931,3344,0,"Good reflection Alex! SHO Time features a lot of different events that different types of students tend to be more comfortable with. What will you do to make sure that all students gain the most of each event for their own personal growth? To what degree is it necessary to alter the """"plan"""" to aid certain students and to what degree is it necessary to try to push students outside their comfort zones?",,,1
455,871,3351,0,Thank you for participating so much in our group discussion. Your fresh comical insights kept our committee's time on Old Main Lawn fun and lively. Remember these observed interactions when SHO Time arrives this fall as many freshman will be nervous trying to impress others and gauge others investment levels in newfound relationships!,,,1
456,873,3351,0,Thank you Carolyn! This is a great point to remember come SHO Time this August. While we cannot force our mentees to put away their phones we can encourage them to stay involved in their immediate surroundings as the relationships they make during SHO Time will remain with them for the rest of their lives at PSU!,,,0
457,896,3344,0,Thank you for sharing your Personal Mission Statement Tessa. It is clear that you are very motivated to have an impact on others and to give yourself the opportunity to grow and learn new things. As we move towards SHO Time consider what you will do to create an environment that lends itself for other students to be open about their goals and share their aspirations for their time at Penn State?,,,1
458,899,3353,0,Natalie this was a very well-written post. I can see that you thought deeply on the topic of teamwork and its connections to SHO TIME. The few days of SHO TIME will be extremely busy and can definitely be stressful. Having strong teamwork prior to and during those days will be crucial to both the success of the events and to the enjoyment of the incoming students. I completely agree with you about trust. It really is an indispensable skill in any work setting or other life event.,,,1
459,867,3353,0,Alex I really enjoyed how you provided a specific example where maintaining the relationship is key: when a mentee isn't able to make an event. It's very likely that can happen. Like you said SHO TIME is meant to foster the relationships among the incoming students. Having that dialogue with a student who may be unable to attend an event is crucial to developing the mentor-mentee relationship. We should all be aware of keeping such connections as they can really improve any students' time.,,,1
460,931,3353,0,Alex I completely agree with your post. There are times when a student may not feel included in the activities for many reasons. You make a strong point: that being a Schreyer Scholar implies that you have what it takes to improve other lives. We all have what it takes. If for example an incoming student does seem to be shy I suggest we try and nudge them a little bit. We shouldn't push them too far out of their comfort zones,,,1
461,1032,3353,0,Joe I really enjoyed reading the specific experience you had with group interactions and teamwork. I could not agree more on the stress you place on effective communication and early defining of roles within groups. Having such in place won't be all that is necessary to succeed but they will surely set any group on the right foot. That's why we have so many meetings throughout the semester planning out the details for SHO TIME and making sure everyone is updated on each others' roles.,,,1
462,865,3353,0,Joe I really enjoyed reading your observations on the HUB Lawn. We sure did see a lot of activities going on around us during our discussion. I recall you telling us about your experience with the CHEM 457 project. You mentioned how it was hard to get the project started due to the other members all being seniors with jobs already. I can definitely understand the struggle there. During SHO TIME I feel that we should all be mindful of getting planning done early to reduce any possible stress.,,,1
465,908,3353,0,"Marisa it was a pleasure reading your previous experiences and how you learned from them. I can closely relate to how you felt when you were younger. Being a leader does not mean that you're constantly """"nice"""" to everyone. Sometimes like you said it is necessary to get your point across and be a bit more harsh. In SHO TIME most of the work should be delegated nicely but if it's necessary to do so",,,1
466,965,3353,0,Marissa that's a great observation! I really enjoyed how you structured your post and could not agree more with the common denominator you mentioned. People interacted with each other positively because they felt comfortable where they were. In SHO TIME as leaders we should all strive to do just that. Make sure everyone is comfortable wherever they are during the orientation. It'll be just like a HUB Lawn.,,,1
467,1028,3353,0,Grant great job relating key ideas with each other. Problem solving and teamwork revolves around every single moment of our lives and really is a crucial skill to possess anywhere. I like how related it to a personal experience - your research lab. During SHO TIME communication problem solving teamwork,,,1
468,979,3353,0,Sneha I really enjoyed how you referenced your Engineering Design 100H course. I'm sure it must have been difficult for you and your team members to function together at such a different part of your lives - college. We should keep in mind that the incoming students for SHO TIME will be experiencing the exact same thing. They are all transitioning to a different stage of their lives and may be overridden with emotions. That and like you said being honest with others will help a great deal.,,,1
469,896,3353,0,Tessa I really enjoyed reading about your passions and thoughts. I definitely agree with all your points on how creativity relationships learning and experiences are all critical components in life. All of those will help ensure we keep growing as people and evolve to adapt to certain situations. It's very similar to SHO TIME. During the few days of orientation,,,1
470,1027,3347,0,I'm so glad that you enjoyed our day Marisa!  It's really funny to see that as unique as we all are our status as Penn State students does give us that shared enjoyment of some pretty classic Penn State attractions.  I'll be interested to see how the group develops throughtout the summer and if the people you pegged as leaders and supporters early on stick to that role - I personally think you're all great leaders!,,,1
471,955,3347,0,Ceci your post is making me miss State College more than I already do!  I definitely agree that with more time we could have made our day even more perfect.  I personally think it would be awesome if our group could get together another time and do some of those other things you mentioned (especially the Pokey Sticks!) but you're right- what you do isn't as important as who you do it with!,,,1
472,966,3347,0,"I think it's so nice that you took the extra time to appreciate one more perfect aspect of the day: your perfect milkshake!  It really is those little things that can turn a good day into a perfect day and I don't think people stop to recognize those things as often as they should.  And like you said the weather is another one of those """"little things""""... I could definitely go for a beautiful day on Old Main lawn right now!",,,1
473,1005,3347,0,I also finished my first visit to Penn State with a trip to the Creamery!  It really is incredible to think that it's been 3 years since that first visit and that this once strange place is now as familiar to me as my own hometown.  Funny that something as simple as ice cream can serve as a reminder of change hard work and the excitement and fulfillment that comes with growing up!,,,1
474,1021,3347,0,What an action packed day Jamie!  I think the inclusion of a Penn State sporting event is a really awesome choice because those events tend to exemplify some of Penn State's most central values like hard work perseverance and community.  Plus,,,1
475,1025,3347,0,You're definitely right Danielle that our perfect day was probably the break everyone was needing right before finals week.  I know that for me it's really important to take a step back from the stress of school and remind myself that there's more to life than work.  Thankfully,,,1
476,1026,3347,0,I think it's interesting that you repeatedly mention bonding as a team throughout your reflection.  While it's true that we went out of our way to visit some classic Penn State landmarks I think you're right that what's more important is that it gave us the opportunity to get to know everyone a little better.  I hope that everyone feels like our Perfect Day made us a stronger team that is ready to take on SHO TIME 2016!,,,1
477,1031,3347,0,I bet Penn State outsiders would be amazed to see that we were able to fit so much excitement into just one day!  It's truly a testament to the rich and exciting atmosphere of State College and the adventure-seeking attitudes of the students who live there.  I hope we can still find some more exciting things to do to bond with our committee come August!,,,0
478,1022,3356,0,Casey I think this mission statement is a great way to look at things. Focusing on developing skills outside the classroom is a very important part of college and it's important not to lose sight of that. A lot of fields look at the different experiences someone has when considering them for an internship and the like. I do want to warn you though that focusing solely on grades is a slippery slope. Focus on improving yourself and the good grades will come.,,,1
479,976,3347,0,It's funny that something as simple as getting ice cream can be an opportunity for reflection (and that it can turn strangers into friends!).  As you mentioned the personalities of our group seem to blend well together which I think makes us an even stronger team.  Here's to hoping all of our decisions go so smoothly (and include more ice cream) once August comes!,,,1
480,897,3356,0,I think one of the most important parts of this is the fact that you've figured out how to apply this mission statement to more than just your career or some form of professional development. One of the best ways to develop these sorts of mentalities like you're talking about is to live it (no pun intended). Sometimes the best way to make a difference is to just lend a hand and I can see that you're already great at that.,,,1
481,884,3356,0,Spencer I really like your mission statement's overt goal to inspire and motivate others. I feel like that alone is something that we're looking for and hoping for in a SHOTIME mentor. I would like to see in one of these reflections a discussion on how you specifically are improving yourself. Have you been getting that coveted 4.0? Or are you just doing a little extra each day. Either one is commendable for its own reasons and I can't wait to see what you do.,,,1
482,981,3356,0,Kokila I find it great that you're working on finding balance between our two goals of improving yourself and improving the world. I think these two goals tend to go hand in hand but being able to separate them and work individually is admirable. I think the idea of soul searching to find yourself is an important one to have and it's definitely one that should be shared with the SHOTIME students.,,,1
483,900,3356,0,A cool part about your mission statement is that you want to keep for those who don't have the same experiences as you what others did for you. It's definitely the kind of skill set that we need in SHOTIME and maybe it's the sort of thing that we need in life. I'm sure the students who are under you will appreciate the guidance that you can offer.,,,1
484,913,3356,0,It's great that you mention developing closer personal relationships. Many people forget how important that is to personal health. It's also an important skill in these pivotal years of school. Those sorts of relationships are exactly the type of thing that is important for SHOTIME mentors as we want to make sure the mentors and the students have a great relationship that they can rely on for the rest of their time at Penn State.,,,1
485,964,3356,0,I think an important part of this is your focus on integrity and passion. I'm sure there's a fortune cookie somewhere that says if you combine those two anything can be done. but it's true. That's the type of determination that that can make dreams come true. I also like that you keep your goals open. You might not be 100% on what they are but you know you'll strive very hard at them.,,,1

496,983,3348,0,Emily I really like that you're always trying to challenge yourself by filling your life with different activities. Learning to better yourself and also being aware of your accomplishments is very important. Keep doing what you're doing and I'm sure you'll go far in life!,,,1
497,964,3348,0,"Gabby I really like your motivation in writing this personal mission statement.

498,981,3348,0,Kokila you're totally right that creating a mission statement is hard!

500,972,3348,0,Nicole it's really great that you want to help people overseas and it's even better that you're passionate about it!

Best wishes to your dreams of working in a global environment!,,,1
501,884,3348,0,Spencer I really like your mission statement because it shows your own efforts in welcoming diversity in your life both ideologically and practically. Many people are not as open minded as you are so it's great to see someone making such an effort to improve themselves!,,,1
502,1017,3348,0,Madisyn I really like how you are putting a global perspective into your mission statement. Something like a mission trip can really change how we see the world and I can see that you definitely used your mission trip to South Africa as a source of your motivation!,,,1
503,1024,3348,0,Mike we all have something to bring to the table and it's great that you're recognizing your own skills to bring and using them to help the world as much as you can. Someone like you with the willingness to help people are important in society to help the world grow stronger!,,,1
505,980,3348,0,Alex your mission statement is so simple and powerful. I definitely do agree about how people will try to avoid showing their passions and these people will find it hard to make it far in life simply because you need to be passionate about what you're doing to succeed in it. I wish you the best in pursuing your passions!,,,1
506,907,3348,0,David I definitely agree with you that you should always lead by example and it's really great that you want to be that example for people to follow. Your mission statement shows that you're very motivated to improve yourself and I think that's a really good quality!,,,1
507,897,3348,0,Haley I really like how your mission statement revolves around helping others and that you use that mission in both your professional and your personal life. With that attitude you will definitely be able to change the world!,,,0
508,982,3348,0,Kavya your focus on hard work on dedication shows me that you are a truly motivated individual. I'm glad that you are doing something that you are truly passionate about because a lot of people don't have that figured out yet.,,,1
509,1023,3347,0,It's so awesome to hear that you were able to go to a school that means so much to you and your family.  I often find myself feeling a little jealous of those students who come from a Penn State family because I think it really brings people closer when they are able to share that sense of community.  It can be a little tough to try to make outsiders understand how special some of the things that go on here are so I'm glad that you have people close to you who can appreciate it all with you!,,,1
510,1027,3357,0,"Great insight on the similarities and agreements of each mentor's """"perfect day!"""" The constancy made for a natural and enjoyable bonding experience.

511,955,3357,0,Building relationships is most definitely important! I like how you mentioned the simple respect and kindness. Getting to know new people doesn't need to be a complicated experience. In fact even if you know nothing about a person simply starting with respect and kindness is the best way to get off on the right foot and build a strong network.,,,1
512,1025,3357,0,Great comment on the necessity to occasionally escape from the stress in the life of a student! Sometimes you just need to step back and enjoy the company of the people around you. Breaks from studying can actually improve your learning and improve your overall studying efficiency!,,,1
513,1021,3357,0,Penn State is definitely an exciting place to spend a day or even a full four years! The activities that you mentioned seem like great ways to meet new people and build a sense of community. It seems like you have no shortage of school pride!,,,0
514,1026,3357,0,Sounds like like a nice relaxing night of making new friends! Penn State definitely contains a multitude of enjoyable activities and they're even more enjoyable when done with a group of friends. It's important to build camaraderie with your peers especially if you'll be working closely with them.,,,0
515,1031,3357,0,Sounds like an enjoyable day! It's easy to find common ground and make new friends with such classic Penn State activities. I'm sure you're able to reflect on the lessons you learned and the sense of community that you built on this perfect day.,,,1
516,889,3346,0,Glad you found a way to share your skills with someone else!,,,0
519,970,3350,0,Susan I really liked all of your selections and the insight that you put into each one of them. I especially liked the painting about the rocks: it can be hard to stand out but being confident yourself and not being afraid to be unique is crucial to developing yourself. Great job!,,,1
520,1030,3350,0,"Cara I really like the """"Modern Limits"""" painting and I think it perfectly captures the experience that a lot of us had when we first transitioned to Penn State. Being able to break down this large and complex experience into smaller parts is the only way we can manage it and I think it's great that you were able to recognize that and find a painting that matched that idea.",,,1
521,1030,3350,0,"Cara I really liked your selection of the """"Modern Limits"""" and your analysis of it. I think that idea reflects how a lot of us feel when we transitioned to college",,,0
522,932,3347,0,I would have to agree with you about the football Zach!  I too have very little interest in football itself yet every year I find myself buying a season ticket because I can't get enough of the atmosphere.  I think I said this on someone else's reflection as well,,,0
523,898,3362,0,I'm taking a yoga class this summer so I'm anticipating the same revelations that you expressed here. Now I still cannot 'whip' as I'm told that I look like Hillary Clinton whenever I attempt it. I hope you had fun with your skill swap experience!,,,0
524,1029,3362,0,I love the Arboretum! I went there for the first time this spring and I've spent quite a good deal of time there this summer. I grew up in the woods doing nature camps and hiking and whatnot too so it really is a slice of childhood. Good reflection maybe you could take your SHO TIME group there in the fall!,,,0
525,892,3362,0,Wow that's an intense language! I'm always amazed at how diverse language really is. I only speak English and a bit of Spanish so props to Cameron for going the distance. I'm glad the experience was gratifying!,,,0
526,933,3362,0,I love seeing both sides of this story(I read Sumit's earlier). I'm sure those communication skills will come in handy come SHO TIME! I'm excited for the Brain Show because I'm sure that the whip and nae-nae will make an appearance. Great work! Keep up the good posts!,,,1
527,889,3362,0,Sounds interesting! I would love to hear more about World in Conversation - I've never heard of it before. It's really cool that you know some Chinese knowing another language is scientifically proven to alter how you think. Good work.,,,0
528,891,3362,0,I'm glad that you bonded a bit with your fellow mentors! A strong mentor network is imperative to the success of SHO TIME. I actually could use some snapchat tricks because I still have some of those hidden trophies left to get and I can't figure out how to achieve them. The dancing sounds interesting too! I definitely want to see it in the fall!,,,1
529,968,3362,0,Hey mentee! I'm glad that you connected with some other mentors it'll be good to know your fellow mentors in the fall. I need you to teach me how to dance I'm hopeless on the dance floor. I'm so proud of you for becoming a mentor this year and I know you'll do great things with my grand-mentees!,,,0
530,989,3362,0,It's cool seeing this experience from three different sides. I'm really glad you three got to know each other better. Hopefully we'll have a lot of interesting snapchat filters for you and your mentees to bond over come SHO TIME! Cool post!,,,0
531,904,3362,0,"I love how you made all those connections just by playing """"I Spy"""". Really cool! I'm glad you had this experience. I hope your summer has been full of good weather and a nice and light workload. Can't wait to see what memories your group makes come fall!",,,0
534,978,3351,0,Thanks for temporarily joining our group Matt! Remember the lessons we learned on Old Main when SHO Time rolls around this August!,,,0
535,935,3351,0,Very neat Alex! It seems like you learned a lot from this unique holiday! We can realize the beauty of cultural variance when we experience a way of life or celebration outside of our normal routines. Thank you for sharing!,,,0
536,878,3351,0,Teamwork makes the dream work! We can learn much from others especially those with knowledge and experience. SHO Time mentors should be like the veteran male cheerleaders you saw on Old Main teaching and showing the incoming freshman how to succeed at Penn State and beyond.,,,1
538,980,3356,0,I'm really glad that in doing this exercise you came out with something different than you were expecting. I think an important part of the mission statement is not to sound good (even though yours does) but to be honest with it.,,,0
539,972,3356,0,"I've been reading a lot of these mission statements and I'm glad that yours includes """"resilience."""" An important part of self development and discovering who you are is to work hard and be good regardless of what is happening in your life and it's great that you recognize that.",,,1
540,1017,3356,0,I notice that a lot of your mission statement overlaps with the ideals of the SHC which I think is fantastic. Either you had these ideals before and you found the best place possible to develop them or you have been inspired enough by them that you've taken them on yourself. If the latter is true then you'll be great at instilling those values to new students.,,,1
541,982,3356,0,Passion is arguably the most important part of any mission statement. Regardless of the goals of integrity and of global perspective without passion there is no development made out of the  mission statement. I'm happy that you've identified that in your life as well.,,,1
542,983,3356,0,"I like that your mission statement doesn't work in generics like """"I will develop."""" You've set goals (such as being challenged) and obviously by being a SHOTIME mentor you're working toward those challenges. I can't wait to see what these develop into.",,,1
543,1024,3356,0,I think the best part of this is that you're clearly doing your best now to make the world a better place. Obviously what you're studying can be developed into something incredible useful. But what's most important is that you live this mission statement in your day to day life with your interactions with friends and family.,,,1
544,893,3374,0,I envy your ability to appreciate art! I unfortunately have trouble relating to artwork in the same way.  But we need people like you to continue the appreciation of art especially considering the emphasis on STEM fields and the subsequent pull away from the humanities. I noticed you are a chemical engineering major however and it seems like you have the perfect balance! Keep doing what you're doing.,,,1
545,1010,3374,0,"It's good to have a space at school where you can feel comfortable and maybe even """"at home."""" My family used to go camping once a year together and I miss that time spent enjoying with them. I unfortunately haven't found my own space but I guess I'll have to check out the arboretum sometime soon! I haven't explored it too much but I have enjoyed lying in the grass all the way in the back. A little bit of sun is healthy! Finding a way to destress is also very healthy.",,,0
546,978,3374,0,People watching is one of my favorite things to do - you learn so much about human behavior! It is especially interesting to do so at an airport. You see such a huge range of emotions! I'm happy to hear that you are constantly thinking about your leadership role and I'm sure that will be very useful once SHO TIME starts. I'm excited to hear about your success as a mentor and about how your relationship with your mentees develops.,,,0
547,967,3374,0,"I really enjoyed the second painting you chose. I laughed a bit to myself because I've felt like that horse on more than one occasion. I feel like every day I find a challenge that I don't want to face - whether big or small. I watched a TED talk once (I can't remember what it was called) and something the woman said really stuck out to me: """"If you wait until you want to do something you're never going to do it."""" I try to remind myself that I have to create my own motivation.",,,1
548,991,3374,0,I can absolutely relate to your second painting choice. I had no final exams during finals week but I had an insane amount of work leading up to that week. Several presentations papers and graded assignments. Time management is definitely the hardest but most valuable thing I've learned since I started school at Penn State.,,,0
549,1078,3374,0,This sounds like an incredible undertaking! I've never worked in business or management but I do have experience promoting things. This year I founded the first annual high school tournament for the PSU Mock Trial Association. Getting something like that off the ground is tough work so I appreciate the effort you are describing and I congratulate you on your success! This type of work ethic is what we need to make this year's SHO TIME a success!,,,0
560,1244,3113,0,Riley well done in your work to manage such a group.  You have an insight into what the moderators for the presidential debates are going through albeit they have 2 participants  compared to your 17. One huge skill you built through this was facilitation.  The ability to manage align and progress with a large group is something of value to any future endeavor.  Kudos and check out this link from Brown University for more thoughts on facilitation: http://bit.ly/1QkLIkd,,,1
561,1350,3537,0,"Good example of how you showed leadership in a situation when you weren\'t \""""appointed\"""" the leader.  It\'s these situations where you really need to use leadership skills to bring a group together to accomplish a task.",,,1
564,1353,3537,0,I hope you get to go on more mission trips with some groups at PSU.  There are numerous groups that do various missions around both the US and the world (often at Spring break as well.),,,0
565,1354,3537,0,What a great learning experience and an excellent way to showcase both hard and soft skills you have developed.  I especially like that you were able to include a small collage photo of the event,,,1
568,1224,38,0,Kara I\'m so happy for you that you\'ve found a dream career path. Lots of people struggle with this aspect of college! How was the first women\'s exhibition game? I would love to hear more via another post or comment. -Emily,,,0
569,1132,38,0,Courtney- Your experience in Junior ROTC is really impressive. How have you continued to practice leadership skills in college?,,,0
570,1136,38,0,Courtney- Thanks for sharing your experience helping your teammates. As an HDFS major you will definitely use emotional intelligence and teamwork in your future. I\'m a fifth year graduate student in HDFS and if you are looking for research or other opportunities in HDFS I would be happy to help (eaw237@psu.edu).,,,0
571,1228,38,0,It\'s great that you found a niche at Penn State after a rough start. Have you had any experiences in Gamma Sigma Sigma or in other clubs that are related to your major Athletic Training? You\'ll gain valuable skills in all your experiences at PSU and it\'s always good to find some experiences that are related to your major too.,,,1
572,1135,38,0,Samantha- It\'s great that you want to join many clubs and organizations! It makes college more fun and you will build valuable connections like you describe below. Definitely update us on experiences you have had in addition to Sorority Recruitment now that the semester is in full swing!,,,1
573,1180,38,0,Celine- I\'m glad you were able to learn from this valuable role modeling. However it\'s unclear what your involvement was in the incident. It would be great to see more posts about things you\'ve done especially here at Penn State.,,,0
574,1283,38,0,Anya This is a great post. It was interesting to hear about your interest in art and creativity. You should consider taking a class at the Center for Arts and Crafts- really fun and great for amateurs! (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/craftcenter/),,,0
575,1333,38,0,Wow Liza what a story! I would have been very stressed if I had to teach a class on the fly. You should consider being an undergrad TA during your time at Penn State- talk to instructors and other undergrad TAs.,,,0
576,1354,38,0,Michelle- can\'t wait to hear about more of your leadership positions. I love all the details in this post.,,,0
577,1327,38,0,"Melanie- Thanks for sharing. I would definitely add \""""Initiative\"""" to the list of skills you used here.",,,0

580,1240,3390,0,This is a great story. Especially for recruiters to see you leadership skills and philanthropy. This is a really good post.,,,0
581,1302,3390,0,"Your wording can be improve in the beginning of this post. \""""I developed the soft skill of self-awareness since i could look back on my actions\"""" is an awkward sentence. Very wordy too. There isn\'t much flow to this post. You jump from family hiking story to your brother\'s leadership skill at Penn State. Try to focus on the flow of your post next entry. I like at the end you talk about one of your leadership skills. However I think you should consider revising this post.",,,0
583,1304,3390,0,"This is a great post that could use a little of tweaking with word choice. Other than that I like how you connected the nature in the arboretum to the story when you were 10yrs old. You chose the perfect soft skill of \""""curiosity\"""".",,,1
585,1369,3390,0,This is a great post about how you apply the things you learned in this event. I agree that social media has taken away from our privacy but it is how you let it is the key.

If there is any chance you can add more to this post i would put how this experience mode you specifically in a professional setting.,,,1

594,1191,3092,0,Hannah- I\'m glad you could learn so much in just one weekend! I believe that the best kind of leader is adaptable. In this case if nobody had stepped up to develop the plan would you have? However it\'s great that you recognized your natural leadership role. Here\'s my favorite article on the topic: it gives concrete actions to become a more well-rounded leader.  http://www.championshipcoachesnetwork.com/public/385.cfm,,,1
595,1188,3092,0,"Alaina here\'s a story for you: when I was younger I was pretty shy but now my friends know me as \""""SO good at meeting people.\"""" I now love talking to strangers and going to events alone- it\'s the best way to meet new people! Plus making new connections will make your career and life much better. As I found this is something that comes with practice. Set a benchmark for yourself to have a conversation with someone new each day. You\'ll learn some interesting things and it\'ll become a habit.",,,0
596,1202,3092,0,Your first sentence made my day- at Live It we\'re based on the power that reflection has to create personal change! I encourage you to post more entries reflecting on life experiences.  Have you thought about how leadership and reflection work together? The best leaders constantly seek improvement: using what they learn through reflection they alter their thoughts and behaviors to become more effective.,,,1
597,1378,3537,0,"Nicely written succinct explanation for all three of your choices. Think about how you might respond if an interviewer saw this and asked about your wanting to be the \""""best of the best\"""" but the job requires much collaborative teamwork. You are correct that you need to be at the top of your class to enter Athletic Training but you might need to think about and explain how you can achieve that and still be a great team player.",,,1

610,1333,3113,0,Liza this sounds like a very rewarding experience and use of your time.  It sounds like you differentiated to meet the needs of each learner which is key to rapid learning growth.  Some folks would have goofed off without the lead teacher being in the room so cheers to your initiative.

611,1326,3113,0,Melanie I\'m so glad you shared this experience as it truly captures a great opportunity from your high school work that translates clearly to college and beyond.  I also served as a student council member in my high school and actually gave the keynote for our graduation.  It was rewarding and required the skill tags you identified here.  These skills will continue to pay dividends as you head into your career.  I certainly used these skills when I worked for Hilton hotels.,,,0
612,1078,3113,0,Zach this is a great post to show how you were able to tame multiple tasks at one time.  Your ability to partner with other individuals and agencies will certainly be a cornerstone for you in the finance field.

614,1383,3571,0,This is a great reflection on which pieces are of art you connected most with. However I suggest maybe just sticking with on piece of art per post It feels like you connect most with Peacock Blue and Yellow Seaform Set with Yellow Lip Wraps. To better your skills in critical thinking you can put yourself in a situation where it involves this skill. The best way to strengthen and further develop is by doing!,,,1

616,1377,3571,0,I can relate to you on this one You really hit the nail on the head. I think this post really encapsulates what you have learned as far as how to solve your attention span problem.

617,1376,3571,0,Wow you did a lot for your team!!! This is a great description of how you used and developed your leadership skills.

If you get involved in any of the sports even if you are not a team captain you can still work on your leadership skills in a way that you seem to love!,,,1
618,1316,27,0,Hi Cara! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life and through this reflections you\'ve shown that you understood the importance of this skill. I would also recommend that you consider other skills that you have developed in the process. \'Risk Taking\' or \'Adaptability\' could also fit in this post as you described conquering your fear at a young age. Keep it up!,,,1
619,1307,27,0,Thanks for sharing your experience! The Arboretum is a great example of how community service can make an impact on society.

620,1184,27,0,Great reflection Yoonsuk! The great thing about art is that any concept can be interpreted in several different ways especially when the viewers come from different backgrounds and perspectives. In the digital age more and more companies are hiring teams overseas to work together. Possessing intercultural skills is imperative in this generation to be able to communicate with people of other cultures. Keep it up!,,,1
621,1174,27,0,Thanks for sharing this experience! I see that you\'ve developed great skills from your experiences. I would suggest that you focus on one narrative to dive deeper into the story and reflect on that.,,,0
623,1192,3571,0,I think you did really well reflecting on the Shaver\'s Creek experience. You really encapsulated your leadership skill development well.

626,1304,27,0,Hi Elle thanks for sharing your experience. Unsure of how your leadership experience relates to the reflection. I would suggest you add a little more focus in your narrative and hone in on the skills you developed at that given moment. Other than that good work!,,,1
627,1310,27,0,Thanks for sharing your experiences! Having a sense of self-awareness is very important. It leads to the development of emotional intelligence skills and can help you in your personal and work relationships throughout your life. Keep it up!,,,1

Throw up the Creativity skill tag for this post. You did a really great job in really helping the reader envision the blueberry picking trip.,,,1
633,904,3571,0,I would maybe even add the adaptability tag to this post.

637,968,3571,0,This is a really great story! It really embodies your intercultural Skills tag very well!

You could also learn from others as well.,,,1
638,1247,27,0,Allowing people to share each other\'s ideas is critical in the work environment especially when trying to execute on a concept or new project. Startups deal with this on a daily basis.

639,892,3571,0,I would definitely add the intercultural skill tag for this post as well.

They are really great people and you do some pretty fun stuff with them and its not a religion-specific group!,,,1
640,1299,27,0,Thanks for sharing your experience! Dislocating your arm must not have been a fun memory. And that is very admirable of you mother to care for your grandmother.

646,713,3113,0,Katie this is a great reflection piece on a difficult decision.  My wife also was on the pre-med path and found the same thing (mainly because of organic chemistry).  She had to question her end outcome and got a minor in business. It worked out well as she landed a role as national marketing manager for a cable ad company.  Cheers to you on making the switch.

647,1211,3571,0,It is great that you were able to connect to your inner values through this retreat. I highly suggest the ontinuation of this discovery by participating in other groups or activities in PSU or at home. You described your skills very well in this post!,,,1
648,870,27,0,Katie thanks for sharing your THON experience! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life which is why the skill is important to develop. This post really encapsulates the idea of how you understood the importance of teamwork and used your skills to help your team. Good job!,,,1
649,1192,27,0,Great reflection Marissa. I\'m happy to hear you had a great experience at your retreat. Being a good leader also means being a good teammate. As Shannon said get involved with orgs on campus!,,,0
651,1191,27,0,Hannah thanks for sharing your experience! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new experiences. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!,,,1
652,1217,27,0,Nice reflection Amy! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!,,,1
653,1210,3092,0,Emily it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree with your last point of getting to know yourself your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in some of this kind of activity outside the classroom.,,,1
654,1206,27,0,Great reflection Megan. I\'m happy to hear you had a great experience at your retreat. Being a good leader also means being a good teammate. And you\'ll see that throughout your college and professional career. As Shannon said get involved with orgs on campus!,,,1
655,1210,27,0,Great reflection Emily! I would also suggest tagging the skills \'Self-Awareness\' and \'Teamwork\' to this post. I feel that these are skills you developed to complement your leadership skills. Good work!,,,1
656,1202,27,0,Nice reflection Lauren! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!,,,1
657,1211,27,0,Great post Alexandrea! Retreats are a great way to rediscover yourself. If you\'re looking for more leader or teamwork activities find some orgs to join at clubs.psu.edu! Keep it up!,,,1
658,1205,3092,0,Victoria- I\'d love to hear the stories behind the different experiences you had at this great internship!  I see a lot of potential for more entries I\'m guessing here it was hard to fit everything into one here. Since you were exposed to so much variety consider writing a few entries that go in-depth by demonstrating how you learned these valuable skills.,,,1
659,1205,27,0,I agree with Helena! You seem have learned several things from this internship. Feel free to break up by project or event!,,,0
660,1208,27,0,Nice reflection Alexandra! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!,,,1
661,1212,27,0,Great post Tram! I\'m glad to see you were able to learn a lot from this experience. \'Teamwork\' or \'Leadership\' are other skills you could tag on this post since the retreat aimed to help develop those skills. Nice work!,,,0
662,715,3092,0,It\'s awesome that you took the initiative to learn more about this problem as well as develop a way to educate others. Having done a weight-restricted sport in college and having a lot of athlete friends I know there is a need for education on this subject.  I definitely suggest reaching out to other PSU women\'s teams and staff who work on athletic nutrition counseling to keep this project moving forward. Consider getting others from your team involved as well- many hands make light work!,,,1
663,1208,3092,0,"Sounds like an enlightening experience! The hardest part about being a leader is still applying those three \""""pillars\"""" during tough times when your natural human reaction might be to do something different that is less effective or even damaging. Now that you understand the philosophy behind being a great leader how are you putting this into action? I\'d love to see another entry on a real life leadership experience and any surprises you encountered while implementing the above.",,,1
664,1220,3092,0,Agreed on your last point- great leaders help those around them reach their potential rather than focusing on \'leading.\'   I\'ll always remember being completely paralyzed with fear at one point during a similar high ropes course in college! I\'m glad you saw how that\'s an important lesson in emotional intelligence: in life there will always be stressful times that come out of nowhere. The faster you can recognize and address your negative emotions the better off you\'ll be.,,,1
665,1217,3092,0,Amy- it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree on the importance of getting to know yourself and your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in an activity outside the classroom where you can find this balance.,,,1
668,873,3571,0,This seems like it was a very enlightening experience for you. I believe that you can use this same type of obersavtion in other scenarios to help you further refleect and work on developing skills through reflection. This was very well written and you asked yourself a lot of good questions!,,,1
669,877,3571,0,I am not entirely sure if this post is about how you were accepted into the program  or if this was the process leading to it. I feel like you should take an experience what happened after this process and reflect on what you learned during one scenario within the group. Reflecting on an experience that happened with this group can help further develop your skills!,,,1
670,872,3571,0,This is a GREAT position to write about and self-reflect on! You should pull from what you learned about your THON reflections on doing things for others. If you reflect on that very moment I believe it will make for a great post on what you are capable of in terms of your skills. Your writing style is very expressive and puts good imagery in the readers head!,,,1
671,876,3571,0,Being a woman in the engineering field is hard eespecially when it is considered a male-dominate field. It is very important that you have this drive and passion for your degree especially in engineering! You should take your experience with children from this post and further elaborate into another post. It seems like you were really happy with this position and it shows in your tone of writing.,,,1
672,874,3571,0,THON seems like it has had a big impact in your life so far! I highly suggest writing a post on THON as a whole experience in addition to what you have done invidually with your groups. It is really impressive that you have done so much so far and are passionate with the things you do.,,,1
673,1396,3571,0,I really like the connects and imagery you are creating! From reading this post your connection with your spirit painting shows your dedication and drive to plow through your struggles. I am not sure where the war belongs in the post though but I believe your self-reflection overviews what you have gone through and how you\'ve grown from it.,,,1
682,1284,3571,0,This is nice that you summurized the event so we could see how it looked from the groups perspective! However You should definitely show how this helped you and how you had benefitted from this experience as well!,,,1
685,735,3571,0,This is nice to see that you have the communications skills to work with other people and discuss your future with other people! You are on the right track with the explanation of the development of your skills. Your leadership skills are also especially important.,,,1
686,733,3571,0,Quite an interesting title! This post shows a lot of your teamwork interpersonall skills. I believe you are understanding the point of these posts and I highly suggest creating more posts to frame your personal skills!,,,1
687,1365,3537,0,Nicely thought through connections from your life experiences to the artwork you chose from the museum collection.  One way to improve a reflection is to give a specific example that supports how you feel about something.  Example:  What part or specific aspect of the St. Jerome painting represents your faith.  You did this well with the first two works of art and examples from your life.,,,1
688,1356,3537,0,Nice job writing concise but well supported reflections on three different pieces of art within a short paragraph.  You obviously gave some depth of thought to how you and your aspirations relate to these different pieces as well as telling a bit about the artwork.  That makes interesting reading!,,,1
689,1333,3572,0,Hey Liza this is awesome! It\'s great to hear about someone like you taking the role of a leader to help those who want it most. You determination not to give up in difficult situations is admirable. This experience is a wonderful example of leadership but I would love to hear more about how you feel it will help you in your future. Often times experiences we learn from resonate in our future decision making tell me about what this experience meant to you and how it will affect your future!,,,1
690,1364,3572,0,"Nikki - all of these are awesome skills to have that can be applied in many work settings! One of my favorite quotes is \""""sheer effort enables those with nothing to surpass those with privilege and position.” Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of problem solving or acting out good work ethic to give a better idea of how you operate. These stories make for great potential future entries consider breaking down some of these learned skills into separate entries!",,,1
691,1328,3572,0,What a great way to leave high school - on a high note! This story is great because it took so much work to get your to your ultimate goal of attending Nationals. Consider adding the teamwork tag to this as well since you reflected upon your team skills. Contemplate all it took to get you to finals; the hard work challenges and initiative are all aspects you integrated to ultimately reach your goal. The specifics of what challenges you faced can later be applied in other settings!,,,1
693,722,3572,0,The Martian is one of my favorite movies! This is a fun way to reflect I would suggest going more in depth on how you would problem solve and how those skills would be valuable in the other places you mentioned! It seems what you learned about problem solving goes hand in hand with your takeaway don\'t be afraid to elaborate. What takeaways did you have how will these help you in the future?   Explain how Matt Damon’s antics in outer space relate to you here on earth with specific examples!,,,1
694,278,3571,0,This is a great summary of the movie. However from this post I am not completely sure where you used your problem-solving and criticial thinking. I suggest either editing this post or creating a new one to showcase the skills you learned during this movie experience.,,,1
697,237,3571,0,I think you  should include a picture of you painting It sounds really great and would compliment your post well! You described how you overcame your obstacles and frustrations very well this is a great post to showcase your skills to recruiters!,,,1
698,458,3571,0,This was a great program to be involved in. Groups like these in college are great to develop skills for your future and yourself in general. I highly suggest creating another post that focuses on a scenario where you can further elaborate on your leadership skills.,,,1
699,187,3571,0,"I like most about this post the sentence \""""We cannot be afraid of trying new things.\"""" I highly suggest making a post of a scenario you faced in an engineering course that you can also apply these risk-taking skills to. This will show recuiters more about how you are not afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone for the goodness of your team.",,,1
700,260,3571,0,You did a really good job encapsulating the experience you and your team had at Green Bowl. I highly suggest creating another post that can help you better describe your skills in more detail. This post could be about any scenario you feel fit!,,,1
706,439,3571,0,This post was written very well! It is great that you were able to elaborate on your experiences and specifically tell your reader the process of your project. Adding the picture was a good touch.,,,1
709,769,3571,0,I like the explanation of the thought processs of your flavors at Sweet Frog. This shows the decision making skills you have and is desirable to recruiters to see this process.,,,1
710,200,3571,0,I am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.,,,1
714,161,3572,0,I’m glad you got to know your group partners while enjoying delicious food! I wold suggest expanding on what you learned how you executed it and why this matters to you. What takeaway did you have and how will it help you in the future? Breaking down the process of your night at Green Bowl will help to explain how these great skills resonate with you and can later be applied in other settings.,,,1
715,249,3572,0,Hey Paul! You seemed to really enjoy The Martian which is awesome! It’s great you were able to observe so much going on in the movie but summarizing less and reflecting upon yourself more is a better use of the skill tags. Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of how you would use ethical judgement or creativity to problem solve as opposed to telling me how Watney did it in the movie. Keep up the good work!,,,1
716,771,3572,0,Devin - Green Bowl is a great place to try new foods! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant. Did you feel as though you tried something new did you learn anything surprising about your friends? Explain to me why you chose the creativity and intercultural tags here! A quote I try to remember is “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”,,,1
717,464,3572,0,This is very intuitive! I’m glad you could find a piece of art that truly resonated with you. You’re right not may people do know what they want to do for the rest of their life and often times become overwhelmed in thinking about it. I hope you are involved in other activities outside of school your leadership and insight is inspiring. I would love to read more posts about you taking the role of a leader and helping others!,,,1
718,209,3572,0,You hit the nail on the head! Teamwork is an important aspect in life not just the classroom or on the court. The cheesy saying “teamwork makes the dreamwork ” is something I tell my own group members all the time. Recognizing these traits paves the way for you to take initiative and be the leader I would love to see future entries of you reflecting upon taking a leadership role. Check out this TED Talk on teamwork when you get a chance! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yKBitO8M,,,1
719,465,3572,0,Hey William this is a really great and inspiring story. I would suggest adding the critical thinking and emotional intelligence tags to your post given you worked very hard to find what major you wanted to do and incorporated your families’ history of working in the railroad industry! Taking initiative to figure out what major you fit best and going to college,,,1
720,170,3572,0,Joseph - this is a really great post! Your insight into why the activity matters outside of 2000 degrees is a great representation of communication and reflection. If you enjoy creative extracurriculars that pertain to your major consider joining the Penn State Robotics Club! Keep up the good work and remember “art without engineering is dreaming and engineering without art is calculating.”,,,1
721,265,3572,0,Hey Jason! Green Bowl is a great place to step out of your comfort zone and break barriers. I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends how do you feel being pushed out of a comfort zone was helpful? Elaborate more on why you chose your skill tags and how they are applicable in other places outside of Green Bowl. A quote I try to remember is “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”,,,1
722,337,3572,0,Hey your summary on the movie is great but try to take what you learned from Mark Watney and apply it to yourself! For example try talking about a challenge you’ve faced and the solution you used to resolve it. You can do this by expanding on your feelings about communication issues you’ve faced in engineering,,,1
723,449,3572,0,Andrew - this is an awesome entry! Explaining how you adapted in a tough situation shows leadership skills and flexibility. My only suggestion would be to add a takeaway; yes you learned a lot from this experience but what does that mean for situations off the mountain? I would also suggest getting involved with Penn States Skiing / Snowboarding clubs if you aren’t already - you would make a great instructor and team leader! Keep up the good work!,,,1
724,804,3572,0,Hey Alicia! Thank you for sharing your experience i’m glad you had a good time! Here’s what I suggest; expand on how your experience at the show how will it resonate with you in other places? Did you learn something new or unexpected? How with this experience with your team help you in the classroom? Elaborating on these points will help to give a better understanding of how you plan to apply learned skills in different scenarios - such as the workplace!,,,1
725,224,3572,0,Hey Suryan thanks for sharing your experience! Your insight into The Martian and its’ relation to the current state of the aerospace industry is very intuitive. Here’s what I suggest; take what you learned from The Martian and your knowledge on the aerospace industry and apply it to yourself. Take time to reflect upon how who you are and what you know will be an attribute to the work place. Elaborate on times you\'ve used critical thinking and conflict resolution!,,,1
726,338,3572,0,Abdulla - thanks so much for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends why will this experience be valuable in the future? Elaborate more on why this experience was notable and how it will help you in other places outside of Green Bowl!,,,1
727,359,3572,0,Hey I love your style of writing thanks for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job linking the experience to skills that will be useful in many other places outside Green Bowl however try to reflect more on yourself and less on summarizing the event. Elaborate on how trust was established and conflicts were resolved to give a more well rounded view of the activity being an exercise in skill building!,,,1
728,731,3572,0,Hey Kevin! Your writing is very strong thanks for sharing your experience! Here’s what I suggest; focus less on summarizing the event and more reflecting upon what this event taught you. Elaborate on how risk taking and teamwork will resonate with you in the future not just in Green Bowl. Don’t be afraid to focus on yourself explaining what you learned from this experience as opposed to summarizing it,,,1
729,377,3572,0,Hey Ting! Thanks for sharing your experience with watching The Martian! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job reflecting on how this movie relates to you however I would love to see you expand on your goals to become a great engineer. How do you plan to do this in what ways do you strive to make society a better place? Your takeaway from the movie was right on track elaborating on your last few points will just help to wrap it up nicely!,,,1
735,200,3571,0,am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.,,,1
736,158,3571,0,This is very important that you can master these skills and be able to also hold yourself to a standard as well as communicate with your team during dinners like these. In your future career dinners like these with both your team and clients will happen.,,,1
737,839,3571,0,I suggest writing more about your experience your audience can really get the idea and see the development process or usage of your skills.  You should reflect on your experience at rotellis and what you learned.,,,0
739,354,3571,0,I highly suggest elaborating more on how the movie pertained to you and your skill development. This will show recruiters the process of how you develop your skills.,,,0

809,1315,3537,0,Great example of some soft skills and an experience that would be good interview discussion.  Just take another look at your last sentence.  It has at least one type and doesn\'t read quite right.,,,0
810,1215,3537,0,It would be great to make another entry/reflection on this class now that you are half-way through the course.  Would love to read about what you have learned about yourself and others!,,,0
811,1387,3537,0,Well done writing succinctly but in a meaningful way how you relate to these three different works and what they symbolize for you.,,,0
812,1231,3537,0,You should look in to our Maymester trip to Lyon France. It is a wonderful opportunity to explore both cuisine and culture and you could practice your French language and get some of those skills back (in a hurry I suspect.),,,0
814,1303,3537,0,"Just a quick comment...we would say \""""learned\"""" not learnt.  Perhaps expand on the \""""field\"""" business knowledge you have gained as well particularly related to \""""soft skills\"""".  A separate entry on this with specific examples of experiences that helped you build these skills would expand a future employer\'s understanding of what you can do.",,,0
818,1370,3537,0,Good job of pulling together three descriptions of artworks and how they relate to your life.  Do proof read your entry again and correct the typos (or spelling/grammar) errors.  I think if you read carefully you will find them.,,,0
819,1357,3537,0,I don\'t know if there is a tag for perseverance but it so I would add it to this entry.,,,0
823,1373,3390,0,I love that you took the trip with Dr. Daley and some of you classmates. I like that you were able to develop all of these skills while building relationships with your teacher and classmates. Being able to have peace conversations about controversial topics is a great trait to have when you get into the real world. The traits you have developed in this experience will take you a long way in life. I suggest you keep developing these skills throughout your time at PSU.,,,1
824,1323,3390,0,i love that you were able to sit in the arboretum and reflect on key events in your life. It seems like the arboretum has that effect on everyone including myself. Also Self-awarness is a very important trait to have when you are dealing people from different backgrounds. It is the first step to being able to be empathetic.,,,1
825,1312,3390,0,I believe that the ability to identify with piece of art is what makes it so beautiful. Now that you have identified pieces of art that you can relate different events in your life to you are more likely to be able reflect on the lessons you learned in those experiences. This is exactly what happened to you. Adaptability self-awareness and creativity are all great skills to have in order to be successful in life.,,,1
826,1296,3390,0,I love the imagery that you are creating with your word choice in the beginning. As I read your post I feel like I am there. Your father\'s dedication to teaching you the sport of track seems like it has been huge in your development. I believe that teaches you a lot of lesson including leadership that will make you the best all around professional you can be.,,,1
828,1512,3572,0,Sarah - this is very cool giving back to your local community is a great way to get involved. I see you used the teamwork and community engagement tags expand on this! What did you do to personally to contribute did you run into any problems what was the process of raising money? Don’t be afraid to make yourself shine! Live It is all about student success,,,1
832,1317,3390,0,The arboretum has the breath taking effect on people. Its truly amazing and always brings back nostalgia. After reading your post I am very happy that you have an understanding of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is very important and it is a major key to success. Another skills I see that you developed was the ability to connect your past to the present. Thats a great skill to have because our past serves as point of reference for us to see the blessings we have in life.,,,1
836,1300,3390,0,Wow I\'m amazed. I was a Kinesiology major in my undergraduate and I didnt get a Personal training certification. So congrats to you. This shows you are goal driven and very cognizant of your future. That is a good trait that you should never lose. Kinesiology is a great major and while in it you will learn what you want to do for the rest of your life.,,,1
837,1330,3390,0,i agree that in the past there was a lot of masculinity and love of men. You are right to say that this is still relevant today. We have a long way to go for gender equality to be reached. This post definitely shows that you have a good understanding of self-awareness.,,,1
840,1306,3390,0,Great imagery at the beginning. Great story about the plant you mother gave you. We all have things that our parents or guardians have given us that we hold dearly. It shows a lot of responsibility to be able to take care of a plant. Also your story shows that you have the ability to juggle a lot of responsibilities at once.,,,1
841,694,3571,0,This was written very well. This was a great experience to elaborate on. I highly suggest further creating posts such as this in similar tone and style with more like experiences. I feel like you would gain from joining a community club at Penn State.

911,1541,3537,0,So glad to hear you say reflecting became a habit!  It is so very important to think about and reflect on what you are learning and your experiences so that you can first soak them in and second figure out how to improve in the future.

912,1567,3537,0,So glad to hear you found this engaging and are excited to explore further.  This was a first for my PSU14 sections so I\'m really glad it hit the mark for at least one student!,,,0
913,322,3571,0,this was a good experience you had. However I highly suggest further explaining the skills you learned during this scenario. It will better help recruiters understand the way you develop and use skills.,,,0
916,721,3571,0,I would further discuss any scenario or obstacle that may have happened during this event. Use that obstacle to your advantage by telling your audience and recuiters through the posts how you developed skills (or used them) during this time.,,,1
917,132,3571,0,This was a good observation about not being botanist since it is a different approach that would be taken in the movie as opposed to real life with engineers. I highly suggest further expanding this post by creating another and further elaborating on the plan your team came up with in order to survive this situation.,,,1
918,776,3571,0,I highly suggest futher building on this post by elaborating more thoroughly the development and usage of your skills.,,,0
919,133,3571,0,Rather than saying which skills and why they would be useful during a situation like this you should relate the situation to a scenario you have faced before or will with your team in which you can use the skills from the tags you put with this post.,,,1
920,767,3571,0,I would further expand on this post and elaborate on the development and usage of your skill tags rather than just a short explanation of each one. These posts if used effectively should be able to help you better explain you and your skills to future employers and recruiters.,,,1

957,247,3571,0,I wanted to let you know you do not need to highlight the skill tags within the post. You can solely explain the development or use through the personal story of your situation.

958,249,3571,0,I would use this continuation to further explain your personal use of the skills.,,,0
959,772,3571,0,I wouldn\'t particularly say this is presentation skills. aI would put this under risk-taking and initiative.

Instead of writing your conclusion about the experience first consider writing it last as a takeaway. Summarize the event reflect upon what you learned then give a takeaway to tie up the paragraph. Your writing is great,,,1
970,159,3572,0,William - this is a good entry! You gave a fun background of the assignment as well as had a strong takeaway that concludes your paragraph nicely. However I would suggest adding more reflection in between the two.

971,932,3572,0,Hey Zachary! Your writing is very strong I could picture the perfect day in vivid color! That being said consider taking more time to reflect as opposed to summarizing.

985,895,3572,0,Jack - while your descriptive writing is overwhelmingly vivid consider spending less time summarizing and more expanding on Leadership JumpStart. Ask yourself; what did you learn how will it apply in other places do you consider yourself a leader? Unpack what you learned from them / your own team. If you\'re having trouble linking blueberry island and Leadership JumpStart consider separating them into two different posts! Keep up the good work!,,,1

996,1584,3390,0,This is a great lesson to learn early. Privacy is important when you are working in healthcare.

1017,1663,3572,0,Joel I really love how your brain thinks in ways mine couldn\'t possibly fathom. Consider diversifying your Live It portfolio by writing about different topics.

1046,1361,3572,0,Hey Maeve it seems your entry got cut off! Consider rewriting it in order to conclude your entry!

1589,2294,4053,0,But you can't see this?,,,1
1590,104,2820,0,Hey this is a comment from 2/23,,,1
1591,2224,3964,0,Thanks for adding your thoughts here Joanne.  How have our sessions at the school met or challenged your expectations?,,,1
1592,2310,4036,0,Josh great story! I can understand how frustrated you must have felt but I'm glad that you got through it. It's often easier and better to focus on how you should adapt to your environment and your teammates. It's also nice to see that you acknowledge your professor for what you've learned. Not many students give credit where it's due nor do they appreciate adversity in situations. I think it's great that you learned and grew from a frustrating situation- that's an invaluable experience that not many people take away from their time in college.,,,1
1593,2309,4036,0,Josh thanks for sharing your story! It sounds like there's a conflict of interest within your group or within the entire class. If people cannot find the time to make it to a group meeting or pull their weight in a group project it sounds like they might not be interested in the course or that they are not passionate about Project Management. I'm glad that you got through it and understood the value of working together and priority setting.,,,1
1594,2312,4036,0,Hi Ololade thank you for sharing your experience. You made a good point and observation about the impact of one's actions versus their intent. One's intent is meaningless unless they make an effort to show how dedicated and interested they are in learning about cultures. I'd like to hear more about your perspective on this as well as your thoughts about your own intent and actions. What did you learn about the actions/interests (or lack thereof) of others on the trip? How does that shape your appreciate and passion for other cultural understanding?,,,1
1596,2315,4036,0,"My favorite quote is by Carl Jung and he says that """"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."""" This is a great story and a great example of how to overcome adversity in the workplace. Working on a project/organization that you're passionate about with people who work differently from your own style can be very challenging and difficult but I encourage you to think about how this situation would pay off in the long run and in your career. Although it might be difficult for you consider right now I think that you'll learn a lot about your strengths and have a great opportunity to work on your weaknesses when it comes to working with people who are different from you. The best part of experiencing a problem is the ability to work through it and learning from it.",,,1
1597,2319,4036,0,"Hey Wesley I think it's great that you learned and realized what the power of being a leader entails. Teamwork collaboration and communication is very important in any industry but particularly in technology ultimately leading to innovation and impactful changes. I'd like to learn more about what made you come to this realization that teamwork is important and how your role as a leader """"diminished""""?",,,1
1598,2320,4036,0,Wesley I think you made a great decision and it sounds like you learned a lot from your experience. You made a great observation about how egos have no place in the workplace and that's true. It can be personally difficult and challenging to look past one's ego and to let others take the lead without being offended and it's very admirable of you to reflect and learn from this situation. As you grow and develop your skills I think it would be valuable for you to reflect upon your desire to be team leader in the first place and what made you change your mind.,,,1
1599,2322,4036,0,Anthony it sounds like you've learned a lot during your time abroad in Russia. I'm glad you're able to capture your out of classroom experiences on this platform. I think it says a lot about your awareness if you can reflect about specific experiences about your summer abroad. I'm sure that you realized by now that your observations are very meaningful and valuable for you in the future to allow reflect upon your interactions with a diverse group of people in different perspectives.,,,0
1600,2323,4036,0,Anthony thanks for sharing your experience about your mission trip. Similar to your entry about your study abroad experience it's important to take a step back and reflect upon your interactions and experiences with people who come from different backgrounds. I think one major take away from your diverse experiences is to be able to take a step back and meet your audience with empathy and self-awareness so you can effectively get through to them with your perspective and to influence them with your passions and interests.,,,0
1603,2359,4036,0,Morgan thanks for sharing your post. It's great that you're realizing the importance of dialogue and perspective. I think it's wonderful that you're able to take a step back from your own views and perspectives to learn about others and to discover more about yourself and your interests. It also sounds like you're taking healthy risks and are keeping yourself informed about different cultures that are different from what you're familiar with.,,,1
1612,1661,3767,0,Hi thank you for the comment. Are you the only one who are responsible to make comments?,,,0
1616,2461,2803,0,That's a great quote!,,,0
1618,2587,4231,0,Well said. An added value is that when you write a reflection peers can communicate with each other on that specific reflection or summary.  Thanks!,,,0
1619,2594,4252,0,This seems like it was a great experience. I encourage you to think about how debating someone in a professional manner can stretch across your career opportunities. It is a tough skill to master but allows you to grow professionally.,,,0

1631,2729,3745,0,Thank you for sharing this Kristine.  To be fair I'm not sure I've found myself at 33. Life especially when you are ambitious is a trial in learning and perseverance.  My family didn't understand why I chose to get a Masters degree or move around the country repairing broken school systems.  They saw the immediate need for me to be safe and secure.  What you are proposing is brave and 1 skill you will want is the ability to ask for help.  Not from a place of weakness but rather self-awareness. TY,,,0

Emotional intelligence is very hard to understand and many people go through life without understanding it. Yet the fact that you were able to experience it,,,1
1887,3839,2568,0,Hey Matt thanks for sharing. You make a good point about how challenges and hardships can shape you to be more resilient in the end. Life presents often presents you with different opportunities to learn about yourself and they often come as challenges that you've never faced. These challenges allow you to learn about yourself like how do you overcome them? View them as opportunities to improve yourself,,,1
1888,3847,2568,0,Hey Emir! Welcome to the Surge family. I'm so glad to hear that you're adapting so well to your new internship! My role is to support you in ways that will help you develop and grow.

1890,3835,2568,0,Hi Paulette! Thanks for stepping up to be the lead intern--it shows that you have a lot of initiative and that you are looking to challenge yourself in new ways. Way to go!

1914,3907,4864,0,Hey Abigail! My name is Andrew I work with Kristine who visited your class recently. Great piece of work! For only your second time using pastels it looks fantastic. You've done a great job identifying the soft skills you learned/experienced through this. These are so important to recognize throughout your life as they aren't discussed in academia. Even though it was a tough drawing you've done great and don't stop!,,,0

1951,4484,4036,0,Hey David great story. Not only did you exemplify great communication skills but it also sounds like you developed showed problem solving and teamwork. You managed to get on the same page with your co-captain and strive to work together to get on the same schedule to achieve the same goal. The skills you talk about here are traits every business needs to succeed.,,,1
1952,4484,4036,0,Also I think a picture would be a fun addition that would bring your story to life!,,,1
1953,4489,4392,0,Factssssss,,,0
1954,4499,4036,0,SJ what a well written post! Thanks for sharing your insights and feelings about how you felt about the miscommunication. You and the AFGG team did an excellent job working together to get the job done. In particular I personally thought you had one of the best attitudes toward executing. Not once did I hear you complain. You were genuinely interested in solving the problem and working together and motivating your team. So props to you! :),,,0
1955,4489,4036,0,Braxton you and the team were responsible for so much before the event and you were one of the team members who contributed to the success of the game. You were one of the strongest and committed team members who showed determination and teamwork. You were also one of the most hardworking members of the team as you were willing to help others get things done. The team and the kids involve admire all the work you put in and you should be proud! Great job Braxton and thank you.,,,0
1956,4489,4036,0,I hope you were able to learn a lot about project management while being collaborative and results-driven!,,,1
1957,4458,4036,0,Sounds exciting SJ! Enjoy your trips :) I hope you see a lot of new things and learn a lot more!,,,1
1958,4456,4036,0,Glad to hear you're enjoying your college life a lot more after switching! What do you love about IST and how did you see yourself change in the past year of you switching?,,,1
1959,4455,4036,0,Ah online SRA group work. I minored in SRA and finished most of my courses through world campus too. Doing group work with others online was not easy for me especially because students taking World Campus courses online were very different from what I expected. A lot of those who I worked with were moms/dads and in the military so coordinating times to meet with them virtually seemed almost impossible for me! What challenges are you facing right now?,,,0
1960,4454,4036,0,Emir I'm sure you're having a difficult semester and I know it's really stressful! What I admire about what you said is being able to find the ability to redirect your attitude and to embrace the challenges you're facing. It wasn't too long ago that I was in the same shoes as you- juggling 18 credits internships and figuring out my future! (AHHH!!) It's all about how react and handle everything. In the process you learn so much about yourself and what your capabilities and weaknesses are.,,,0
1961,4453,4036,0,It sounds like there are so many changes that are occuring in your life right now. I think it's very fitting of you to select adaptability as a tag because that's exactly what's going to be required of you in these coming months. I hope you see the value in the challenges you're enduring and learn a lot about yourself in the process.,,,0
1963,4653,4409,0,Cute. I see what you did there. Great post!,,,0
1965,4893,4967,0,Great aspirations! Keep on it!,,,0
1966,4883,4967,0,Keep on it!,,,1
1967,4898,4967,0,I think its great you want to work on skills that are learned and not measured like soft skills. Keep us updated on your progress.,,,0
1968,4907,4967,0,I think that keeping timelines are important to keep projects on track. Good luck with handling obstacles!,,,1
1969,4903,4973,0,In past few days working with you I personally think you have good communication skills. Self-reflection is indeed a great way to improve oneself. As I also want to improve my communication skills as a team worker I see it important to take a step back and self-reflect to acknowledge problems and take a mental note to solve such problems.,,,1
1970,4896,4980,0,That sounds like a really good goal this summer and it seems like this would be the perfect place to accomplish that.  I get the feel that here at Surge they will give you the help you need in order to start get going on your project.  I’m kind of curious to see how it will turn out.,,,0
1971,4785,4925,0,Hello Sung I also had the same path where I was not sure what major I want to be in. Within my time at the university I was conflicted between business and information sciences and technology. When learning about both majors I decided at the end to choose information sciences and technology after learning about how it fits into the business world. It was interesting that you made your websites through PHP and SQL whereas I created my websites through the use of HTML and CSS. Lastly I agree that strivi,,,0
1972,4785,4970,0,I  can definitely relate to the feeling of not knowing what to do or major in when entering college. Double majoring seems like it would be difficult especially because it is IST and accounting. It seems like you have a really good grasp on it though! Finding something you enjoy like SQL seems like it helped a lot...I need to find something I enjoy like that for myself,,,1
1973,4785,4971,0,I'm also double majoring in one of the business major and IST too and was totally able to relate to your reflection. I really like how you started with something you are good at then moving on to the next step with your passion.,,,0
1974,4785,4970,0,can definitely relate to the feeling of not knowing what to do or major in when entering college.

Finding something you enjoy like SQL seems like it helped a lot...I need to find something I enjoy like that for myself.,,,1
1975,4898,4973,0,I agree with you Jeff. I'm starting to notice that once interns have started to work they realize how important communication skills are. Being able to articulate your opinion in convincing ways is of utmost importance in any fields you decide to enter. As I'm also a huge proponent of communication I would like to improve my own.,,,0
1976,4904,4973,0,I see you definitely learn the environment and be a good coworker with others. Keep up the good work!,,,0
1977,4898,4971,0,Communication skill is something that I want to improve upon as well. Meeting and communicating with the clients will surely improve communication skills while working in a project. Being an effective communicator can definitely be helpful throughout the career.,,,0
1978,4898,4968,0,I agree with you that communication is very important in the full time work field. I am also trying to improve in that skill during this internship and plan on doing so by communicating with every intern as much as possible.,,,0
1979,4903,4980,0,Building up my Communication skills is probably the skill I want to improve upon the most this summer too.  I agree that one skill that isn’t really taught in school is how to have good communication skills with a client.  So through this internship I’m hoping that I’ll be able to refine these same skills.,,,0
1980,4905,4925,0,I agree that communication is a skill that individuals will need to work effectively in a group environment. Through this summer I also intend to work effectively in a team environment through communication. When giving an insight of what possible solution there are towards a project it is best to understand every individual idea and allow them to share it. I also look forward to working with you during the summer internship.,,,0
1981,4901,4970,0,Word press seems interesting I think learning it along with wore frames will be very valuable. This team environment will also be good in helping achieve your other goals.,,,0
1982,4906,4968,0,Hello! I hope you are able to complete this goal this summer. It is very important to have a voice in meetings and conversations and this skill plays a big roll in any professional fields.,,,0
1983,4905,4977,0,Hi ! I agree that communication is one of the important skill to have in order to be successful in your team. I think this internship can really help you to be more engaged and also develop a better communication skills.,,,0
1984,4903,4960,0,I agree that it is important to have a great communication skill others feedback are also the critical role to improve communication skill. I hope to have a great teamwork with you and improve goals together.,,,0
1985,4896,4964,0,I like how you plan to take baby steps instead of trying to tackle it all at once.,,,0
1986,4906,4964,0,I think you have really good goals and that you can accomplish them in this environment since we are all on the same level and have open minds to new ideas,,,1
1987,4900,4969,0,I think those goals are very good to have. I too am going to try to learn WordPress and get a better understanding of its creation process.,,,0
1988,4903,4969,0,I have not considered communication as part of the goals that I wanted to include as part of my summer goal. However reading your post has encouraged me to add communication as part of my summer goals as well.,,,0
1989,4932,4969,0,In this post you clearly talked about where you were last year. I think the fast pace of your previous internship really allowed you to adapt to change. However do you have any insights on how you are now? You did not talk about how you are this year.,,,0
1990,4930,4964,0,I really like how you didn't give up after a rough year and you ended up bouncing back and excelling to where you are today.,,,0
1991,4931,4969,0,I was in a similar place to you last year. I was content with my job and my course in life so I didn't worry too much but this year has really opened my eyes to professional business development that I never had the chance to experience before.,,,0
1992,4932,4970,0,Sounds really interesting and like it was a great experience!,,,0
1993,4932,4973,0,Your 2017 summer experience sounds so much interesting. Especially the world we live in such an adaptability to fast changes is greatly appreciated. In addition it's great that SURGE extends your experience with design as it is not direct interest of mine.,,,0
1994,4924,4977,0,Hi Justin (Best friend :)) !! I'm so glad you found an internship for this summer and happy that we're working together. I hope that this internship teaches us many helpful things and help us to grow.,,,0
1995,4930,4973,0,I'm glad that you found what you enjoy the most. Majority of people is not fortunate to go through such an experience. It indeed strikes them at their later stages of life. However I urge you to still keep exploring different fields of study as you might find even more fitting one.,,,0
1996,4857,4988,0,Hi Manae!! Wow!!! Your story about joining a sorority and the experiences you gained from it sounds pretty amazing. I'm also in a fraternity that is also Asian-Interest so I can relate well to your experiences joining Greek life. From my own experiences in Greek life I've had the amazing opportunity to meet people from all over and learn leadership among other valuable skills.,,,0
1997,4857,4988,0,Hope you enjoyed this comment BEST FRIEND,,,0
1998,4931,4988,0,Hey Jeff I think you experiences learning and transitioning into a professional world are key to success. The transition isn't always as clear cut or as easy as we may think it is. Keep it up!,,,0
1999,4927,4970,0,The internship in China sounds like it was also a good experience. That internship along with this year at Surge should help you build for your career.,,,0
2000,4928,4975,0,That's really good to hear that you were able to manage working and attending Penn State while managing to achieve your goal of obtaining your desired GPA.,,,0
2001,4926,4975,0,Around this time last year I was in the same boat as you while working at a local carwash. I'm happy that we have achieved our goals of obtaining an internship doing something we love.,,,0
2002,4926,4967,0,Nothing wrong with making some money in the summer. Im glad to see you have developed professionally.,,,0
2003,4932,4980,0,That sounds like an awesome opportunity.  You don’t see a lot of people who are in the IST major working for fashion design companies.  It also sounds like you got a lot of good experiences through this internship too.,,,0
2004,4935,4967,0,Sounds like you are learning some professional skills!,,,0
2005,4935,4975,0,Like you I once was not ready for the field I would be working in and this last year has really developed me professionally as well as within my field of study.,,,0
2006,4935,4971,0,It's really good to know that you learned so many things and still trying hard to learn new things.,,,1
2007,4927,4971,0,It is great that you realize what you are short on and now trying to learn and overcome your shortcomings.,,,1
2008,4932,4925,0,Working in a design company in South Korea sounds like an amazing experience. It is great that you can incorporate the skills you learned in college to a business environment. Although I do not have any past experience I am hoping during this internship I will be able to apply the information I learned through my college experience to the work environment.,,,0
2010,4927,4925,0,It is great to hear that you had internship experience before. Having the work-experience consist of computer hardware is something relating to technology. Through opening up opportunities these experiences help develop ideas of what you want to achieve. As you stated the experiences will not only help you for graduation but also for your professional development which is what I seek in my current internship.,,,1
2011,4932,4960,0,Change is a common thread that runs through all businesses today and all organizations must change quickly it's good to learn how to manage change. That's a great internship experience.,,,0
2012,4964,4967,0,Sounds like a great experience!,,,0
2014,4965,4969,0,I think your entry is very accurate. I had a lot of fun being part of the team with you. I think the teams were divided between people who were competitive and those who were not.,,,0
2015,4963,4969,0,Hey Alex I think your post is an accurate depiction of the escape room. I really enjoyed being on a team with you and shared in your competitive spirit.,,,0
2016,4948,4967,0,Sounds like you are learning a lot! Keep on it.,,,0
2017,4917,4988,0,Hi Manae! I'm a little confused on what projects you are referring to especially since we're all working on multiple ones. If you have any questions feel free to always reach out to Kristine team leads or head interns. P.S. Hi best friend!!!,,,1
2018,4965,4971,0,Teamwork was definitely a huge factor in the escape room.,,,1
2019,4960,4988,0,Hey Jeff I agree with your comments about how we work in a professional setting. Escape the Room provides a more situational view of how we interact and how we think.,,,1
2020,4964,4977,0,Hiii! I agree this experience helped me gain communication skills critical thinking and leadership skills. I really enjoyed being in the same group as you:) But I also think that the group number should have been smaller so everyone can contribute and complete the escape room together.,,,0
2021,4964,4971,0,Problem solving skill is something that we need to hone regularly to keep the feel of it. I think escape room was a good exercise to train our skills too.,,,1
2022,4966,4925,0,It is great that the IQ Escape room was a learning experience for you. Not only did you have fun working with others this allowed you and fellow interns to enhance their teamwork skills. This is important as you work together during the internship.,,,1
2023,4933,4980,0,That sounds like not only a really cool experience but also a really good learning experience too.,,,1
2024,4963,4925,0,It is great to reflect on the fact that not everyone is experienced in escape room. Although most of the team is not experienced as you have stated they completed the tasks successfully. I believe that every intern is determined and put effort to help the team which lead to success in the escape room.,,,1
2025,4964,4968,0,Hey Justin! I'm glad that your group was able to solve all the clues and finish the escape room on time. My group also had setbacks but we also worked together to get past every step. The escape room was definitely a great experience for building communication and teamwork.,,,1
2026,4961,4925,0,That is great that you had experience in the escape room where you can lead the team. Having the escape room as a competition against another team is effective in encouraging individuals like you to work harder to help the team.,,,1
2027,4965,4963,0,I cant agree more the escape room is extremely team oriented and driven. With out a strong team it is difficult to complete the tasks on time. I agree overall it was a lot of fun and  a good team bonding experience.,,,0
2028,4992,4969,0,Hey Phong I think your statements regarding the teamwork at SURGE is extremely accurate. I have noticed that the interns worked in a very professional manner in meetings and being very open with ideas. Everyone was very involved and taking down ideas and mixing in their own aspects.,,,0
2029,4988,4969,0,Hey Tim I think your observation in Kristine's management has been quite correct however I think you do pretty well as a leader. The tasks has to be taken by somebody and those that want to work on something will most likely speak up. There are a lot of tedious task that we have to do but every task is a learning experience.,,,0
2030,4999,4967,0,Very valid points. I think that communication is key!,,,0
2031,4994,4967,0,Glad to have you! I find the environment to be very open and innovative.,,,1
2032,4999,4970,0,I agree communication makes group work a lot easier. The teamwork aspect is a unique part of this internship and makes it more enjoyable than other internships may be.,,,1
2033,4986,4967,0,Very good work!,,,1
2034,4999,4972,0,Hi Manae. I agree that communication is the most important aspect in a team. A team cannot function properly if the members within it cannot bring themselves to work together to achieve a common goal especially back and forth between clients.,,,1
2035,4998,4972,0,Hi Keon. Communication is definitely a big factor that plays into working in a team especially at Surge. I think that what makes a team function well in a working environment is how the members speak to each other and how each of them are willing to get the work done especially in a professional setting.,,,1
2036,4989,4971,0,As being a teammate of yours I think you did great job communicating with the team members and delegating works to right people. I really appreciate that as it made the entire team better.,,,1
2038,4989,4979,0,Thanks for your comment. I find it very important to utilize each other's talent here together we learn grow and succeed!,,,1
2039,4993,4979,0,Agreed! It is great that slack helps everyone to keep each other updated and we can easily check it on different platforms as well.,,,1
2040,4999,4925,0,I agree that teamwork is a skill that is very helpful in preparing oneself to work in a job that requires team collaboration. Having every individual in the team communicating effectively and the same understanding of a project is effective towards making progress. Overall I would want to develop my teamwork skills to lead a team effectively in communicating with one another and the ability to express their ideas.,,,0
2041,4999,4975,0,That's a great goal! I think the first way to being would be to participate more in meetings.,,,1
2042,4999,4975,0,That's a great goal! I think the first way to meeting this goal would be to participate more in meetings.,,,1
2043,4997,4975,0,That's great Subin! Communication is key in a team based environment and yields better teamwork and results.,,,0
2044,4993,4925,0,I agree that communication is an important skill to ensure everyone in the team to collaborate together. Slack and other social media devices allow users to communicate effectively out of work. Although this can create a work environment where no one communicates with each other face-to-face one should try to engage in the conversation. I also learned that updating team members is helpful in ensuring everyone is on the same pace with the project progress.,,,1
2045,4999,4989,0,"over the past week we've worked together on the """"wedding barn"""" project and teamwork is key in this environment.  communication is always a great attribute to continue to grow and develop and that is a great goal to set for yourself.",,,1
2046,4932,4968,0,Wow man very nice. It is great that you had experience in other fields other than tech!,,,1
2047,4999,4988,0,Hey Manae!! I agree with what you're saying I think communication between a team is important especially when doing research or any work. You don't want to overlap with other members and want to make sure everyone is updated on what's going on.,,,1
2048,4992,4925,0,It is great that you are having more experience in Surge compared to your previous job. Learning more helps one enhance their skills and taking in constructive feedback is good to take in.,,,0
2049,4982,4988,0,Hey Jeff I think it's pretty cool that you used to want to be in the medical field. Although you aren't in it anymore you're still able to volunteer and help give back to the community.,,,0
2050,4980,4977,0,Hi Alex :) wow your experience sounds amazing. I think it's great that you got an opportunity to volunteer in Philippines and gain some experience.,,,1
2051,4980,4977,0,:D,,,1
2052,4974,4980,0,That sounds like a pretty cool volunteer experience.  I can imagine that being a Sunday school teacher could sometimes be frustrating it was probably pretty interesting though.,,,1
2053,4974,4968,0,Working with kids is a very difficult but rewarding experience. It's a great skill to gain and can definitely help with dealing with people in the future.,,,1
2054,4974,4973,0,That is so cool that you had played with kids regularly as I love playing with kids. There are even so much to learn from them as well.,,,1
2055,4996,4973,0,It sounds like you are genuinely a good team worker. I have not had a chance to work with you yet but I can tell you would be a good team member to work with.,,,1
2056,5036,4925,0,It is great that the internal meetings helped improve the challenges the team has to face in prototyping. Not only that but it also helped identify the deliverables that will need to be done. Communication did become a key component in helping the team understand what needs to be completed and what is required.,,,1
2057,5031,4969,0,Hey FengQi I have seen you working at SURGE since the first day but never really had the chance to communicate or work on a project with you. Reading your post about stepping out of your comfort zone about communicating I think you have been improving and doing a good job.,,,1
2058,5030,4925,0,It is great that your Czech buddy found a way to unclog the food although it ended up creating a burst within the pipes. The scenario of miscommunication where your co-workers did not speak to you about their decision can cause several problems. Adapting to a different type of work environment can be difficult,,,1
2059,5035,4969,0,Hey Alex I agreed that Harvard is definitely a tough project. I did start the first  week with them but it seemed that the Harvard members were very disorganized. They had no background in technology and seemed very unsure with everything.,,,1
2060,5029,4967,0,Sounds exciting. I would like to hear more about your experiences!,,,0
2061,5027,4925,0,It is great that you got out of your comfort zone to run for a position and win the election for the executive position within the student government. The leadership position helped you become a leader and aspire what you want to be in the future.,,,1
2062,5036,4970,0,The Harvard project seems to be one of the most interesting projects of the summer. With so many moving pieces I can see how communication would be difficult. From the outside looking in it seems you are flourishing as the leader of the group.,,,1
2063,5030,4980,0,That’s definitely an interesting experience.  That had to be really difficult considering you guys didn’t speak the same language.  After this event did you ever learn more Czech?,,,1
2064,5033,4963,0,Wow very interesting keep up the good work Anthony!,,,1
2065,5030,4979,0,Communication is the key. Sorry to hear what happened but glad you learned a lot from the experience.,,,1
2066,5030,4972,0,A very interesting situation that you had to adapt to Patrick. I think spontaneous events such these can turn a typical daily routine into an eye-catching tale.,,,1
2067,5018,4989,0,As a fellow student who envisioned themselves going into the STEM field and later changing to a business path I understand your initial discomfort and applaud your ability to overcome your doubts and take the step to expand your comfort zone.,,,1
2068,5021,4977,0,Wow I didn't know you can sing! Going out of comfort zone is always hard but I'm glad you had a great experience :D,,,1
2069,5023,4970,0,This is pretty interesting and an outside of the box class to take. I'm not much of a dancer myself and wouldn't be comfortable in this class at all. It is impressive you were able to push yourself this far out of your comfort zone.,,,1
2070,5022,4989,0,Taking on additional responsibilities through a promotion is an amazing way to push yourself to grow as an individual and professionally.  I took a promotion in the past and i was also weary of the additional duties but i realized pushing myself into that situation helped mold me into the person I am and I hope you were able to make the same personal and professional developments.,,,1
2072,5035,4963,0,Good job Alex way to be a great team leader!,,,1
2073,5027,4973,0,That is awesome! It's definitely impressive to see you stepping out of comfort zone during your first year. I would have not been able to run for the student government either just like many of us.,,,1
2074,4986,4988,0,Wow Manae!! I volunteer at Nittany Greyhounds during the school year as well. I volunteer with my fraternity to help clean and organize the shelter. We should work together one day!,,,1
2075,5017,4988,0,Hey Anthony I understand the anxiety and nerves that come with presentations. It's not easy and it takes time to build up your skills.,,,0
2077,5023,4968,0,It's great that you were able to adapt to your situation. Maybe you could show us some moves next time!,,,1
2078,5031,4971,0,I think you have been great in terms of contributions to projects and it is great that you are still trying to improve yourself.,,,0
2079,5037,4975,0,Prototyping is great skill to have at hand as a project is only as valuable as the prototype that it set the precedent for.,,,0
2080,5032,4977,0,Thank you for introducing us to Adobe XD and I'm really glad that we all learned how to prototype on it. Good luck on the Project !,,,0

2094,4881,2820,0,Hello Michael,,,1
2095,5098,2820,0,Hi Michelle.,,,1
2096,5098,2820,0,WASSUP,,,1
2099,5138,4969,0,The project you undertook sounds awesome and really encouraging. I think it is great that you took this project.,,,1
2104,5139,4925,0,It is great you took the initiative of learning about how to fix your car taking action yourself instead of waiting is a great way towards facing conflict.,,,0
2108,5139,4970,0,This is an awesome outside the box post. Not many people have the ability to fix their own cars and would just panic when something goes wrong. So it was nice to read about something different that most people can't do.,,,1
2112,5133,4970,0,Class projects are always a challenge it was creative to ask a family member for help. This is not something I would have even thought to do. This is a great problem solving technique.,,,0
2113,5139,4967,0,Sounds like a process you don't want to mess up. I might need to call you for some help when I need to change my oil.,,,1
2114,5133,4967,0,You seem like a very precise person. Attention to the detail is important and I am happy to hear you got it done.,,,0
2116,5137,4973,0,Great to hear your management of challenges. I had the same issue with figuring out clients' exact needs.,,,1
2118,5136,4925,0,It is great that you took the approach of learning a new skill such as photo-shopping. Not to mention you took the initiative of learning by developing your own work and having the desire to improve it. Lastly when faced with the conflict of blending the faces in the pictures you did not give up even when you could not find any resources to help you. You were able to successfully complete the project and blend the faces.,,,1
2120,5138,4975,0,Wow! That seems like a tasking project to manage and on top of that having to get the audience to interact more.,,,1
2122,5133,4973,0,That is very impressive. Figuring out syntax errors is extremely frustrating and challenging to do. Understanding the project and pushing yourself to finish the project definitely helped you figure out syntax errors as well.,,,1
2123,5139,4979,0,Your techniques on steps and overall problem solving is very logical and great.,,,1
2125,5137,4979,0,Finding what clients want and what we have is necessary steps in doing projects. Glad you were able to use your previous skills to solve the problems.,,,1
2133,5135,4977,0,Hi Sung I also agree that communication is a key when you're working in a big group. Lot of times there are miscommunication so I think making things clear with your team is super important.,,,1

My husband and I had a similar experience in the Dominican Republic. How enlightening right? When you interacted with the people of Nassau what was the “communication process”?,,,1

2160,5325,4997,0,Vydeepthi Wow! Thank you for sharing your Hawaiian Experience. The details and descriptions of the scenery people activities and food brought your post to life. I could almost feel the warm breeze and smell the salty sea. Watching animals in their natural habitat is truly humbling. What is included in a typical feast in Hawaii? As a reminder,,,1

2164,5333,4997,0,Kevin Your experience growing up in Puerto Rico as someone of Chinese ethnicity definitely sounds unique. Thank you for sharing. How did you originally come to live in Puerto Rico and what prompted the relocation to the US? Specifically what differences have you observed in the cultures,,,1
2165,5333,5006,0,I was born there because my parents decided to open up a restaurant business there. I relocated to the US because my parents decided that we can have better educational opportunities in the US. In Puerto Rico the demographic was not as blended as it is in the US because almost everyone was Puerto Rican. The area that I lived in was more rural because the island is very small so most cities were simple with family owned stores and only a couple chain stores.,,,1
2167,5335,4997,0,Danny I can only imagine the fear you must have been feeling. Other than the enlarged lymph node what symptoms if any did you have? I am also curious as to why they sent you to Pittsburg. In any case,,,1
2168,5325,4995,0,Thanks Maddie!The feast included authentic foods from Hawaii New Zealand Tahiti and Samoa. It was really yummy!,,,1
2169,5339,4997,0,Danny Your response is well written and provides concrete insight behind your thoughts and opinions. I agree Face-time is crucial and invaluable! Did you attend a Career or Job Fair this fall? If so how did your personal experience compare with your reflections?,,,1
2170,5316,4997,0,Simon Absolutely. I am here to help you learn and grow. We will experience success and failure along the way but that is part of the process. As always I am here to help!,,,0
2171,5318,4997,0,"Simon I am so impressed with your confidence and willingness to embrace something new. Now that you had such a positive experience with this adventure what is next on your """"bucket list""""?",,,1
2172,5333,4997,0,"Kevin Do you miss Puerto Rico? Do you prefer the US? What are your thoughts on the simplicity of Puerto Rico and the """"complexity"""" of the US? """"Island Time versus Rat Race""""? Does that make sense?",,,1
2175,5333,5006,0,Hello I'm not sure if I miss Puerto Rico but I would definitely like to go back to see how things are now because most of my memories are of when I was young so I cannot remember much. I do have some fond memories of Puerto Rico so I cannot say if I prefer the US or not. I do like the US a lot because there is a lot more diversity different cultures and opportunities than there would be  in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was simple because I grew up around an area that was not very urban.,,,1
2176,5333,5006,0,The culture is much more concentrated because the majority is Puerto Rican unlike the US which is a home to many different cultures and ethnicity.,,,1
2184,5350,4997,0,Shannon Firstly kudos to you for creating a catchy title and including a related photo. Secondly your opinion is solidly backed with personal experiences. Since you have been to two completely different Career Events what makes one “better” than the other? You mentioned that attending a Career Event helped you earn an internship. How do you make yourself stand out in a sea of hundreds of applicants.,,,1
2187,5356,4997,0,Alex A team-oriented sport such as soccer definitely aids in the development of communication skills. Talking on the field is an essential part of success. Specifically how do you think soccer helped you to gain grit?,,,1
2188,5338,4997,0,Danny Thank you for reflecting on a time when you had to use your problem-solving skills. By the sounds of it you were able to successfully regroup and implement a plan. I commend you for having the courage to let your friend go. After all he was not fulfilling the expected duties and requirements. Well done! Remember this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!,,,1
2189,5359,4997,0,Kevin I agree. You definitely took a step in the direction towards conquering your fear of heights. Based on what you shared in your reflection I would say you were extremely brave that day at Dorney Park. Grit could have been a “tag” as well. Did your friends know that you were experiencing varying emotions?,,,1
2192,5354,4997,0,Mollie Thank you for sharing such a beautiful and heartfelt post on the importance of traveling experiencing cultures and protecting mother earth. What if any,,,1
2193,5355,4997,0,Rafay Thank you for sharing your opinions about and experiences with the job interviewing. How do you think this process might differ from one country to the next knowing that cultural expectations and innuendos many come into play?,,,1
2194,5360,4997,0,Shannon I agree. Group activities such as sports are an excellent way to develop and refine communication skills. What specific tactics and techniques did you and your teammates use to connect with one another on the field? What happened if miscommunication arose?,,,1
2195,5358,4997,0,Simon According to many of your reflections you have embraced the Penn State experience wholeheartedly. For the majority of people taking that first step outside of our boxes is quite difficult. As I have said before I commend you for your courage. How do you think your life would have differed had you not attended the Club Fair?,,,1
2196,5353,4997,0,Christine Procrastination is such an interesting topic. Some people embrace it while others steer clear of it. Why do you think that is the case? Now that you have changed your approach to accomplishing tasks how would you advice someone else on finding balance?,,,1
2197,5351,4997,0,Vydeepthi As always you’ve created a catchy title and included a personalized photo. Doing so helps to engage the reader from the beginning. Bravo! Your reflection is especially moving as it captures and emphasizes your selflessness and willingness to volunteer and lead. What makes you gravitate to these types of projects and roles?,,,1
2198,5351,4995,0,Thanks Maddie! I'm passionate about helping people and giving back to the community which is the main reason I try to be involved with such projects.,,,1
2199,5359,5006,0,I believe they knew that I was feeling those emotions because I've told them before that I've never ridden a big roller coaster and that I have a fear of heights. I expressed how I felt after I got off the ride because that's what people normally do after experiencing something new and different they want to share how they felt.,,,1
2200,5370,4997,0,Chris As the Dalai Lama said “Be kind when possible. It is always possible.” On the Thursday morning you described you did just that. How we treat others truly reflects who we are as a person. Do you recall a time when someone was especially kind to you? How did that make you feel?,,,1
2201,5366,4997,0,Kristen Thank you for reflecting on a time when you had to use your problem-solving skills.

2203,5368,4997,0,Kristen I agree face-time is crucial and invaluable! Nonetheless how do you make yourself stand out in a sea of hundreds of applicants? Can you backup your reflection with actual “research”?,,,1
2204,5369,4997,0,Alex As Aesop said “No act of kindness no matter how small is ever wasted.” Experiences which cause us to feel left out or vulnerable definitely encourage us to be more sympathetic and empathetic towards others. Have you ever been in a situation where it was difficult to be kind?,,,1
2205,5364,4997,0,Danny Wow! Not only were you kind in this situation but honest as well. Two qualities that should never be overlooked. When you first approached the lost items and were contemplating what to do what was going through your mind? How did you feel when you realized how grateful the young lady was? What did you learn from this experience?,,,1
2206,5363,4997,0,Mollie Random acts of kindness are a wonderful way to show others how much we care. Do you think all cultures value gestures such as these? Why or why not?,,,1
2207,5365,4997,0,Simon As always you’ve created a catchy title and included a personalized photo. Doing so helps to engage the reader from the beginning. Bravo! Additionally your kindness and selflessness speaks volumes. Hold on to and confidently embrace these qualities. They are truly invaluable. Why do you think kindness comes easy for some and not so much for others?,,,1
2208,5361,4997,0,Christine Joaquin Phoenix once said “It takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal.” Reading your reflection touched my heart. Your act of kindness was so incredibly caring and thoughtful. Why do you think kindness comes easy for some and not so much for others?,,,1
2209,5361,4939,0,Hi thank you Maddie. I think one of the reasons why kindness comes easier for some and not for others is because a person is a product of her/his environment. But of course plenty of people have come from bad places yet still have a tender heart and vice versa so it's a complex question.,,,1
2210,5393,4997,0,Chris I would agree. Organization plays a large role in achieving success. Additionally in our culture in this “day and age” we tend to take on entirely too much. “No”,,,1
2211,5383,4997,0,Alex Wow! Your experience is a true example of failure being the secret to success. Thank you for sharing. As far as skill tags go I would recommend including Adaptability and Grit. You obviously demonstrate both of these the second time around. As always well done.,,,0
2212,5379,4997,0,Vince I agree. With the good comes the bad and with the bad comes the good. Life is all about how you embrace and accept both. You put a positive spin on a negative situation which eventually worked out in your favor. I commend you for that. As far as skill tags go I would recommend including Adaptability as well.  Have you ever experienced a strictly academic failure?,,,1
2213,5381,4997,0,Justin I am in agreeance. Failures teach us more than success. I wonder why that is the case? What are your thoughts? Kudos for trying out for a sport with which you weren’t familiar and for being mature enough to reflect on your wins and loses. Grit and Risk Taking are perfect tags for this post.,,,1
2214,5381,4997,0,Have you ever experienced a strictly academic failure?,,,1
2215,5395,4997,0,Lacey Wow! Like Alex your experience is a true example of failure being the secret to success. Thank you for sharing. As far as skill tags go you did a nice job of choosing the appropriate ones. Well done.,,,1
2216,5406,4997,0,Vince Thank-you for sharing details about your internship with a start-up. Excellent advice I might add as well. Sometimes our greatest experiences come from the most unexpected places. Can you offer any tips or resources regarding how one should go about approaching an internship with a smaller company?,,,1
2217,5388,4997,0,Kristen What a unique topic about which to reflect. Thank you for sharing! Personally I agree wholeheartedly. Musicals should be experienced by everyone at least once in their life-time. They captivate and inspire like no other. Initially what drew you to musicals?,,,1
2218,5380,4997,0,Justin What a heart-wrenching yet uplifting experience. Thank-you for taking the time to share it. I believe it was Aesop who said “No act of kindness no matter how small,,,1

2221,5417,4997,0,"Alex Agreed! We ALL have our own unique imperfections. I commend you for being so perceptive.

2229,5409,4997,0,Justin I've always admired the witches and wizards of Ravenclaw for their eccentricity. They are who they are they are proud of it and they don't care what other people think. We all could learn a thing or two from this perspective!,,,1

2529,6035,2440,0,Thanks for sharing your experience Sean! I agree that it can get frustrating at first especially when the conditions or situations aren't comfortable. It also does take time to get familiar and find your rhythm. I'm glad to hear that your team was able to make progress along the way. I encourage you to take on more challenges like this!,,,1
2531,6038,4997,0,Rachel I experienced my first Escape Room with the summer interns. Like you I had expected to perform well and contribute to my team. Instead I fumbled around barking orders in an attempt to organize my teams' efforts and identify areas of individuals' expertise. Quite frankly I was a bit embarrassed by my execution of my leadership skills.  So. I compiled this list of resources related to leadership: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBc9X4HSB00QBMsRMzg5js5TxTvOJR_6yujNITXmzH0/edit?usp=sharing,,,1
2532,6038,5041,0,I enjoyed reading about your experience at the escape room especially since i was not able to attend. I specifically liked how you compare solving a room in the escape room to the workplace. I can also relate to how while working in the Launchbox there are times where it may seem as if I’m just looking at my phone. However I have been using my phone as of late to help me build a SquareSpace website. Furthermore taking some time to just think does help with generating new ideas and allows for one to gain a better direction of what to do next.,,,1
2533,6038,5042,0,Maddie- thank you for sharing that resource on google docs! I was looking over some of them and it seems really helpful!,,,1
2534,6030,5041,0,Luckily the good thing is that you don’t seem discouraged instead you seem motivated to perform well even more. I know sometimes while taking an easy course especially one that is online it is easy to let off and put in the least amount of effort possible and still receive an A. For me I always looked at these classes as guaranteed As as long as I put in the same amount of effort in these courses as I would for a course related to my major. Keep working hard and get a better grade.,,,0
2535,6037,5041,0,I enjoyed reading about the emotions the art piece invoked from you.This also allowed me to gain more insight about your past and gave me the opportunity to compare it with my own since the piece of art I chose also made me feel nostalgic for my childhood past. Your description of the artwork was also very vivid and allowed me to picture it in my mind.,,,1
2536,6033,5052,0,Thanks for sharing your experience Pam!  After reading about your failure then success I now know to ask questions and clarify details just to be safe.,,,1
2537,6039,5052,0,I also enjoyed the Escape Room.  It is a great way to get to know each other when we don't see each other all that often outside of Surge.,,,1
2538,6041,5052,0,I also felt similar at the start of the internship.  Everything seemed overwhelming but now that I have a schedule balancing the work and school isn't that bad.,,,1
2539,6041,4997,0,Chloe Commend yourself for recognizing that your initial method of time management needed adjustments and for taking the initiative to implement said changes. Self-reflection self-acceptance and self-realization will serve you well in all aspects of your journey.,,,0
2540,6040,4997,0,John I agree with you in regards to your ability to multi-task and execute. You've vastly grown and improved from the first two weeks. No doubt delegation can be difficult. I still struggle with this concept as well. Check out this 2-3 minute read with multiple info-graphics on the topic and importance of delegation: https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/how-to-get-better-at-delegating-and-why-you-should.,,,1
2541,6044,4997,0,Jon I was glad to read that you feel settled into the internship. As far as strengths and weakness are concerned have any new ones developed or risen to the surface? Specifically what do you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses?,,,1
2542,6038,4997,0,Rachel Oh good. I'm glad!,,,1
2543,6042,5046,0,I'm glad I was able to give some of my knowledge on greek letters to help aid the group!,,,1
2544,6041,5046,0,Sounds like you have figure out a way to balance your school work schedule and the program. I need to really focus on this area for myself as well!,,,1
2545,6040,5046,0,Working on nine projects sounds crazy to me when I am on much less and also struggling at times to manage my time.,,,1
2546,6049,5049,0,Satchel it must be frustrating to have those passions and goals for these companies only to be denied by fate money or some other reason.  I always find that acceptance is the hardest,,,1
2547,6042,5049,0,Pam I really enjoyed working on that puzzle with you.  It was a wonderful albeit slightly spooky time due to the ambience; but I definitely enjoyed our surprising amount of progress in such a short time.,,,1
2548,6030,5048,0,Sometimes taking the time to fix your foundation in order to improve yourself.,,,1
2549,6051,5048,0,This Internship allow me to find myself and allowed me to learn more about my strengths and weakness. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to work with my fellow peers.,,,1
2550,6043,5048,0,The escape room was a very fun activity to see how well you can work with your peers under a time constraint.,,,1
2551,6048,4997,0,"Muhammad I agree. Failure is a profound teacher. There is a quote at Launch Box in the kitchen by Drew Houston that states Don't worry about failure. You only have to be right once."""" Check out what Will Smith had to say about failure last year.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/will-smith-failure-is-a-massive-part-of-being-able-to-be-successful.html",,,1
2552,6045,4997,0,Hi Pam. You mentioned that you would like to learn more about web development programming languages. We can certainly figure out how to incorporate that into an existing project or possibly a new one all together. Please email Kerry and I if this is of interest to you.,,,1
2553,6049,4997,0,Satchel Your frustration is certainly warranted. Dedicating time and effort when it is not needed or wanted is discouraging. As far as technical skills go please feel free to have a conversation with Kerry and I with regards to how we might implement more opportunities in an existing project or a new one altogether.,,,1
2554,6058,4997,0,Jack As you have discovered Slytherins aren't all bad. Slughorn Tonks and Snape are perfect examples of the unwavering loyalty that witches and wizards in this house posses. Ricky,,,1
2555,6056,4997,0,"Rachel Ravenclaw seems like a perfect fit for you. Based on what I've observed thus far in the internship you definitely exhibit creative thinking problem solving and emotional intelligence. One of my favorite qualities of witch and wizards from this house is their acceptance and celebration of eccentrics. I love that Luna rocks her weirdness so well and could give """"two shakes of a worms tail"""" what others think.",,,1
2556,6060,4997,0,Satchel No doubt you will be successful and the best part is YOU get to determine how to define it. (A quick 5-minute read:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscarosa/2019/10/20/how-you-can-close-your-personal-success-gap/#2f3b45853ab1),,,1
2560,6064,2440,0,Ravenclaw is a great house. Are there examples of you behaving like a Ravenclaw in the past? How have you applied it into your work or personal life?,,,1
2561,6063,2440,0,I agree that the quiz could be more in depth! Have you tried 16 personalities? It's not a Harry Potter quiz but it is a pretty extensive quiz that categorizes what type of person you are. And from there you can probably decide which house matches the personality best!,,,1
2562,6061,2440,0,Ah yes the crowd favorite. I used to think I belonged there but am proud to say I'm a Slytherin after taking the quiz. Are there examples of you behaving like a Gryffindor in the past? How have you applied it into your work or personal life?,,,1
2563,6060,2440,0,Great reflection! I enjoy the stories your shared to tie in with the house given to you. Big ups for taking pride in who you are as a person!,,,1
2564,6063,5048,0,I haven't tried 16 personalities but I will now! thank you for recommending this quiz to show which house fits me the best.,,,1
2566,6079,4997,0,Chloe No doubt you deserve a well earned break. Although you are not experiencing quite as much stress as in the past is there a particular approach you take when you are feeling overwhelmed?,,,1
2567,6067,4997,0,John I love that you mentioned breathing as a means for coping with stress. Doing so is very powerful. When you get time check out this exercise. This site has powerful resources. https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/,,,1
2568,6065,4997,0,John I love that you made mention of utilizing spiritual and physical (exercise) components with regards to de-stressing. How powerful! You are wise beyond your years.,,,1
2569,6073,4997,0,Muhammad I absolutely love reading your posts. The emotion and self-reflective insight behind your writing is so raw and quite frankly invaluable. Would you like to talk more about your experiences with the various social groups? I'm happy to listen!,,,1
2570,6078,4997,0,Pam Thanks much for sharing your methods for de-stressing. Exercise is such an important part of our overall health and well-being. Endorphins! I too use soothing music essential oils and yoga. Have you ever tried Yin Yoga? Kassandra is my favorite:  https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithkassandra,,,1
2571,6072,4997,0,"Rachel Thank you for sharing such an emotionally raw post. If only we all did a little bit more of this. If I had """"answers"""" I would most definitely share them. To be honest I'm still figuring life out as well. Adult-ing is scary as hell! One beautiful lesson I am slowly starting to learn is that life is about the journey. We've spoken about this before...I wish I would have explored and taken more chances. So I admire you for """"not graduating on time"""". What does that even mean anyway!",,,0
2572,6076,4997,0,"Satchel Obviously you have identified a plethora of """"de-stressors"""" that work for you. Having options definitely is key. Would you mind sharing a bit more about the MMA training that you enjoy?",,,1
2573,6074,4997,0,Sean I love that you suggested physical activity as a means to de-stress. How right you are! Endorphins are key.,,,1
2574,6077,4997,0,Tevin I love that you mentioned breathing as a means of de-stressing. Although simple doing so is incredibly powerful. I shared this resource with another intern:  https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/,,,1
2575,6079,5050,0,Yes the most common way was to talk to someone. Sometimes I called my parents for several hours and at other times I hung out with friends and have a deep talk. A sound sleep is also a way to compensate stress. I am the person who needs sound sleep everyday which makes me energetic.,,,0
2576,6079,4997,0,Chloe Talking to others and getting ample rest are certainly ways to combat stress. In high school I was diagnosed with severe anxiety so I utilize a therapist in addition to family and friends. Doing so has helped tremendously.,,,1
2577,6072,2440,0,Congratulations! It's completely normal to have these mixed feelings. This is a big transition in your life and you're not expected to have everything figured out! The young professional life ahead of you will be full of experiences that you will learn from. So any choice you make will help you grow as an individual in one way or another. Enjoy your big accomplishment!,,,1

2580,6086,4997,0,Jonathan Kudos to you for sharing an unsuccessful communication experience coupled with a negative outcome (bad grade). How would you help to prevent this from reoccurring during your internship at Surge?,,,1
2587,6094,4997,0,Rafael How right you are! In the workforce especially today's teams are more and more diverse. Making sure that each member feels as though they belong and are able to contribute is a crucial key to success. You mentioned a lack of communication among your group. Should that arise during the internship what ideas do you have for addressing such an issue?,,,1
2588,6095,4997,0,Rafael Thanks for sharing this experience. I love and am impressed by the plan that ya'll put into place to efficiently and effectively handle the volume of cars. Have you ever been on a team that didn't mesh and/or work well together? If so talk to me a bit about that.,,,1
