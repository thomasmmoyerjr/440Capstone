Obviously, being stranded on another planet with limited food and water supplies is a pretty bad situation. The astronaut, Mark Watney, begins by finding a way to take care of himself, which was most important for him to survive. He then finds a way to communicate with NASA to begin working on a way to get him rescued. He works with the team on earth to find ways to communicate and come up with ways to survive and to get off of the planet. They use their combined knowledge to perform a maneuver using the gravity of earth to slingshot Hermes around earth to get to mars, and then pick him up within an incredibly small window of opportunity. If I was in this situation, I feel like I would have tried my best to survive, but I would not have been able to get off of Mars.

The astronauts in this movie faced different challenges and they always tried to be calm and think of a solution. All their solutions are really practical and simple because when you are in outer space time is of essence and you don’t have all the resources you need to come up with a more complex solution. I can relate this to my life, sometimes you have to complete certain tasks but you don’t have all the tools you would like due to economic reasons so you need to figure out simple and practical solutions. 
The team on Earth has additional resources and people to be able to come up with more complex solutions but at the same time they can overlooked the conditions of the crew.

Remaining consistently gracious through emotional calls, and the pressure to get every detail right, left me drained at the end of the day. 

Adding to the stress was the knowledge that our work was sometimes literally a matter of life and death: those dependent on our help included teenage asylum seekers escaping gang violence and families choosing paying for rent or a child’s medical treatment.

Needless to say, Google quickly became my new best friend. For example, I found myself drilling holes into our office wall after I decided to equip the office with a standing desk. Of course, this was after I had educated myself on drywall basics and power tools. 

The most vital piece in making myself useful (sorry, Google) was asking questions of my coworkers. My main project was to build, conduct and analyze an original survey of our partner organizations, and effective communication helped me to figure out exactly what information was needed and in what format.

If crawling through every database and website, stalking each social media page, and conducting informational interviews didn’t provide answers, I tried a different approach.

To complicate matters further, we were kept waiting for a few weeks while our client finished up their design for the site. By the time all the designs were complete and the domain/hosting was bought, my team had roughly one week to build this complicated website.

My first year here at Penn State has taught me how valuable well-being is, both mental and physical. As a college student, it\'s easy to develop poor health habits. Classes become more challenging, life becomes more stressful, and somehow, the importance of proper nutrition, adequate rest, and mental relaxation seem to flee from our minds. As an athlete, I\'ve always been conscientious of how my behaviors affect my performance. During my first semester I was determined not to let my busy schedule get in the way of my training, and it didn\'t. But what it did get in the way of was my life. I took time away from sleeping and eating, and in no time I had developed the Female Athlete Triad; a grouping of health disorders that result from low energy availability. Determined to protect others from this disparity, I created this website to educate women on the dangers of the Triad.

To me, this symbolizes a long journey with many stops along the way. By far the hardest I\'ve worked at something was during my high school running career. As a freshman I was near the back of the pack in my chosen sport of cross country. While I had ambitious goals, I had to gain the work-ethic and dedication needed to reach them. Over four years I gradually increased my effort level as I became more and more determined to reach success. While I moved from the back to the front of the pack, I still had even more ambitious goals. Yet, I learned that success is not a straight forward road. Sometimes there are set backs and  sometimes things do not always go the way you planned for them to go. To me, this painting symbolizes my running career because oftentimes you end somewhere unexpected, but at the same time come out better from it.

An ordinary road suddenly appears to end in a giant rocky mountainside that seems to extend far above the flat terrain before it. On the mountainside are layer upon layer of rock and multiple ledges upon which different structures sit. To me, this unusual landscape seems to be a perfect analogy for the journey of life. Each ledge or rock layer represents an obstacle to be overcome. Each time we reach one a new challenge a new one presents itself. People need to be able to adapt to constantly changing  circumstances.

It made me lament that my volleyball team senior year struggled so hard to be a real team. As captain, I tried to get everyone to talk out their issues so we could make a solution and move forward, as that usually worked for me as an individual. That didn’t really work, and looking back, I think it would’ve been more effective to not say anything and let the problems slide. They weren’t as big as they seemed at the time, and it is unfortunate that we let them get in the way so much.

Next, the shell brings back family memories down the beach. Collecting shells along the water’s edge and building sand castles down the beach was time for family. Lastly, the plate reminds me of the family dinners I value so much. My family has defined who I am and I know I could not be here without them. The hibiscus, shell, and plate all represent the family who has gotten me here and the joy I try to find in each and every day going forward.

	I think the three faces of man describe the college experience pretty well. While the painting itself may look a bit over the top and terrifying that is sometimes how it feels to be at college. The three emotions represented are happiness, sadness, and anger. From the fun times to be had with friends on weekends, the stress and despair that sometimes goes along with midterms (hopefully you guys won\'t experience that!), and how you might feel after blowing an interview or missing a deadline. College definately has it’s ups and downs but that’s how you grow as a person. The bad times make you appreciate and enjoy the good times even more.

Our councilor, Tori, at Shaver’s Creek emphasized the importance of encouraging each other. I noticed encouragement boosted morale, efficiency, and created an all-around positive atmosphere. 
During the ropes course, I was surrounded by a great group of girls who helped me get through the tough times and taught me how to trust.

From there, it becomes much easier to have a productive conversation.

Consequently, I was able to respond with a respectful difference of opinion, rather than with an emotionally-driven reaction.

It was different and unique from other buildings here on campus so it somewhat intrigued me to continue to walk through the exhibits. The first few exhibits were of older art and as the mini tour went on the art became more and more modern. It was really neat to see how our world has changed through art, but some elements of older art still remains key in artist\'s work today.

If I do badly on an exam, I make sure to not let myself get too depressed and move on from it. I did learn new technics on how to release muscle tension during the exam. I usually do breathing technics but if I am not able to focus on a question on the exam I will try the muscle exercise. I really enjoyed learning more about how to cope with test anxiety and hope that with these technics I will preform better in my future exams.

It also shows how big and great you can grow up to be. When you see this painting you might feel sadness but you can also feel strength.

Throughout high school I assumed many leadership positions; I was the president of my youth group and president of the Student Movement Against Cancer club at my school, to name a few. Taking on these roles was difficult. Through trial and error, I was able to try out different tactics to see which ones worked and which ones did not. For example, two members of the executive board stopped participating in activities, posing a large dilemma within the group. Instead of confronting them in front of the entire board, I opted to pull them aside individually in order to see what was wrong. This method worked extremely well and I was able to resolve the problems. If I had chosen to yell at them in front of the group, I know that would not be exhibiting good leadership. The skills I learned would help me launch a business because I would use what I know and adapt it to the problems at hand.

I had to be the cashier, while maintaining our buffet for the night, and deliver room services.

Lippold’s design was a 17-inch-square cube box made of polyurethane with five drawers inside. The advantage that these boxes have over other companies packages is that the food inside can either be kept at a hot temperature or a cold temperature depending on the product being shipped. Everything in the kit is recyclable giving FreshRealm another advantage. This invention is making food delivery very efficient.

In order to make a reservation, guests must have a profile, which includes a profile picture. This allows potential hosts to discriminate based on the race, age, gender, religion, etc. of the guest. In order to combat this discrimination, Airbnb has begun to tell their hosts that they need to agree to a new policy that includes a nondiscrimination clause. Included in this policy is the use of instant booking which will prohibit hosts from being able to approve their potential guests. It is unacceptable for people to still be discriminating in this day and age. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to stay in a place without being discriminated against.

It is hard to get a new product up and running and to get companies to back your idea. It takes a lot of hard work, and sometimes it does not pay off. It is also a job done by oneself.

Building a belief in yourself, and others, helps everyone do their best and feel their best when working together, which is essential for any interaction with others.

I have grown as a leader and as a young woman ready to enter the real world with my head held high and arms wide open, welcoming new opportunities and people that come my way. As a young leader, I think it is critical to be self-aware and making a conscious effort everyday to improve myself. The session that helped me the most in my development as a leader was the Strengthsfinder presentation by Dr. Alyssa Brooks.  As a leader, it is necessary to be aware of my strengths and weaknesses. However, I chose the Strengthsfinder over the Myers-Briggs because personally, I focus too much on my weaknesses. The test I did to find my strengths, the results I received, and the presentation given by Dr. Brooks really opened my eyes to what I have to give to a group as a leader and how to hone in on those strengths to be the best I can be. It sometimes takes an outside perspective to make me aware of what my strengths are and that they are valued and needed. Becoming aware of my strengths through WLI has had a positive impact on my personal and professional development, as well as my self esteem. The Women’s Leadership Initiative has helped build my confidence and that is something that is truly rewarding.

I thought being a leader meant being the person with the loudest, and most influential voice, and I see now that this is not the case. Being able to step back and let others take control, and being comfortable with being a follower is just as important as being able to be the one in charge. Sharing leadership experience with others and delegating have more positive impacts on leadership than having one person be in charge all the time.

In a culture that has focused on always fixing our shortcomings, this session invited me to focus and engage in the uniqueness of myself and others. My top five strengths were: Discipline, Responsibility, Consistency, Futuristic, and Harmony.

Being able to handle conflict calmly and collectively shows leadership and will hopefully deepen the relationship one has with another. The self-test on conflict management styles told me I “conciliate”. Essential, I solve problems by finding the middle ground where both parties involved are willing to work together to negotiate or at least come to an understanding. No one likes conflict but the way one approaches conflict is what makes the difference. In the future, I plan on applying this to my career as a physical therapist.

It made me realize that we are, at many times, in the way of our own destiny. Sometimes leaders are busy or in denial of accepting the fact that they are not well.

One thing that the speaker from Textron said that really struck me was: closing the sale is obviously important, but the real value comes from the relationship. I had always though that the sale would be the most important part of a deal, but it makes sense to consider the lifetime value of a customer, factoring in that if you foster a healthy relationship, they will continue to buy from your company. The speakers also gave tips on how to do this. One of the ways was that the sale is not over after the customer buys the product. They stressed that checking up on the customer to see how the product is working a few weeks after the actual sale can make a real impression on someone and can lead to even more sales.

The other type of marketing was recruitment marketing. This is a very different process, as this focuses on people rather than sales.

The hope would be that women would spark the interest in Live It and then it would eventually be a platform that all college students use. Next, based off of feedback from focus group participants, we felt that Live It would benefit from more engaging features such as liking and commenting.

We first began by meeting and analyzing which aspect of Live It required improvement. This led to substantial critical thinking and market analysis to decide which is the best direction to help guide Live It. 
We decided to focus on whether or not rebranding would be beneficial to the platform.  After careful delegation and structuring of the presentation, we each decided which aspect of the rebranding to focus on. 
This project was rich with teamwork experiences, and led to the successful pitch of our idea to the CEO, Mr. Small.

I admitted to the fact that I had no idea what I would find when I began to conduct analyses from the survey data, but I also knew that our team would never progress if no one played around with the data.

However, sometimes we forget about the other forms of media we use, and the fact that employers look at those too. Today, many companies can gain access to view personal social media profiles – even if they are set as private. In her presentation, Ms. Miller provided real life examples of social media being used by employees she manages. Images included inappropriate posts that contained dismissive comments about specific people in the workplace, or the job in general. This affected how that individual was perceived in the workplace and negatively affected them. 

Throughout the presentation, emphasis was placed on keeping work separate from your personal life, and to be mindful of what is being posted on the media. This is important for maintaining your integrity as an employee and keeping your image good for future employment.

Since the use of social media is prevalent in our society, this was a particularly relevant point. In order to keep your private life separate from your work life, you should not connect with employers or managers on social media. Likewise, you should never discuss work on social media. Additionally, for professions that adhere to HIPAA laws, such as physical therapy, it is critical not to discuss any patients on social media.

One of her job responsibilities includes hiring new employees. The advice on integrity and social media coming from her meant a lot more because she knows exactly what employers are looking for during interviews, what is unacceptable from their employees and how certain behaviors or actions come across to your boss. I was surprised by how often employees discuss work on Facebook, and even deprecate their place of work, employers, or bosses. Ann explained the importance of having integrity in your place of employment. Employers will notice those who are good honest employees and those who call off work for unsuitable reasons, slack off, or cause issues at their job. The bottom line is to always represent your place of employment in the best way possible. You should keep work separate from everything outside of work and show integrity in yourself.

Mentoring provides a valuable experience, ideally, for both individuals involved.  The mentee gains the wisdom from the mentor\'s learning experiences and the mentor gains the satisfaction of investing in a younger life, sharing successes and failures.  For example, Stephanie has shared her knowledge about personality and self-development with me.  Through conversations with her, I have a better understanding of my personality characteristics and strengths and how this correlates to the career path I want to pursue.  She has also provided affirmation in areas that I hadn\'t recognized as strengths, raising my self-awareness to excel in all areas of life.  Also, a mentor can provide advice in difficult situations, such as pursuing the next step in a career.  In such a situation, a mentor can serve as a networking resource as well.  Perhaps most importantly though, a mentor can create another meaningful relationship in life.  Mentor-ship creates a valuable experience that can be pursued in many different areas of life.

While we live in a digital age, we must be aware of the decisions we make. Most people today don\'t think of media as making an impact on daily life, but it can. A simple action such as a post on Facebook could change the course of your career. I learned from this seminar the importance of integrity and the needed awareness of social media. 
Integrity is a person\'s greatest asset. Once it is lost, it takes a lot of effort and dedication to get it back. To not lose it, we must be careful and respectable. One day I hope to be a leader. When I am, one of my goals will be to take care of them. I think it is extremely important to not only be careful towards my own integrity but also with my staff\'s integrity. It is my job to teach and help them through their career. I think this is the most important take away I had from this presentation. 
One thing that stood out from this presentation was the difference between a hospital setting and a hospitality setting that I will be in. I think it is necessary to be aware of this difference, because although her suggestions are great for some industries, they don\'t necessarily apply to restaurants and hotels.

This is so important for us to focus on because technology and social media is such a huge element in our lives today.

She talked about how you can stand out in an interview or on paper. I found each of these tips extremely interesting, as I know how much weight there is in a first impression.

Next, we talked about how social media can affect our careers. I believe that social media standards vary upon different industries. For example, in my industry, the hospitality industry, social media is used as a marketing tool by all employees. Often, during work lectures or events, we are asked to take a photo, post it on social media, and then tag it with a specific hashtag. Keeping this in mind, I must be careful about what I post on social media because my profiles are now intertwined with my work. 

My mentoring partnership is excellent! My mentor, Sharon Power, and I have had several long phone conversations about my career path and the choices that I have made this year. I also had the pleasure of meeting her in person, when she came to visit me in NYC. With the help of Sharon, I was able to make concrete decisions about my career path.

She talked about integrity, ethics, and social media, among other things. One of the major things she talked about was the transition from peer to manager, especially since for her it happened so suddenly.  It\'s really hard to go from a position where you are co-workers, to a position where you are now in charge of these people who were your peers not two days ago. It\'s really hard for them to accept that change as well. However, one of the things she talked about that really helped her with that transition was including them in changes she wanted to make. She would ask their opinion and get their input on things as opposed to just implementing changes very suddenly. 
She also talked about social media presence. She said both how we, as employees, should really be careful about what we post since most of the time it is pretty easy to keep track of that. Also, she pointed out that it\'s really important to keep your personal life separate from your work life and to avoid being connected with the employees you manage on social networks.

The larger packages were only a few more dollars than the smaller ones but I was able to get twice the yield after cutting each package in half.

This was a role that involved meeting weekly with a fellow student or staff that was international, and just talk with them. The idea was to improve their English by leading a conversation with them. This reduces pressures they may receive from a teacher, and increases their interest to improve English communication skills. I met with a woman, who's husband was a international Grad student/teacher, in the HUB (main building on campus) to chat with each other. We would often sit near the News TV, so that we could talk about the issues and articles that appear on the screen. 

I enjoyed the conversations and ideas that we discussed, and while the focus was to make her feel more comfortable with English communication, she helped me improve my communication with international students. I work with many international students, as IST is heavily populated with the foreign community. When I entered the university, I had a difficult time talking with students, trying to speak in a way that they would understand, with out sounding like I was looking down on them. And, honestly, I was nervous to talk to them because of the barrier of nationality. But forcing myself to meet weekly with someone and work on my irrational fear has improved my work life now. I understand how to approach someone of a different nationality, and how to be comfortable with a conversation that may not always be easy flowing.

We consulted Google as a last resort for the troubleshooting we had to deal with while completing the extra credit. Eventually, we were able to solve the extra credit problem.

By finding joy in every task that you do, you can be sure that you are putting forth your best work. Another piece of advice that was given to us was that you should remain true to yourself and not cut yourself short. The judge further stated that there are enough people in the world who are going to try to knock you down, so you need to be willing and able to pick yourself back up.

While I'm a christian, I'm interested in exploring different cultures, and I try to encourage discussion amongst my peers. This interest lead to me taking a religious studies course on the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible during my sophomore year at Penn State. Most of the teachings I had been exposed to at the time dealt with the New Testament, so I wanted to understand the front half of the Bible. 

What I found curious was that many people in my ministry on campus warned me against taking this course. They said that it would create distance between God and myself; that it may temp me to leave the faith, but that confused me. I knew there was a chance that my teacher would preach against the bible, or be preaching the bible (two extremes I did not want to see), but I didn't want to be ignorant of my own spiritual text. And I am glad that I took the risk and kept the class. The first day, the teacher said, ""We are not here to discuss the truth or fiction of the bible, but interpret it as a piece of literature."" 

After the completion of that class, I had a better understanding of the Jewish religion and the Hebrew bible, and I wanted (and still want) to learn more about cultures from all areas.

Thinking that I had to go straight through school, college, graduate school, and then off to my career. This thought process changed as many successful women sitting before me shared how they either took a year off, worked another job for a couple years, or traveled after school in order to take some personal time to themselves. Despite not going straight through like I thought was required in order to become the best, they each made it to highly noted positions, some without even trying. This taught me the need to take initiative in my life for the things that I want, even if it means I deviate slightly from the academic plan I have had since I was five.

It is important to make everyone feel valued and bring the whole team along. Another item that makes an ethical leader is to own up to your mistakes. It’s important to understand that mistakes happen, as we are humans and to not shy away when you know it’s your fault. I learned that it’s important compartmentalize your time and make your own balance between work and life.  I thought it was interesting when Judge said, “Women are care takers, and no one takes care of them first.” I think as a leader it is so important to take care of yourself. As a women, I know I have the tendency to care about everyone but myself, and I also have a tendency to become a workaholic at any job.  It's important to always set goals and get feedback for improvement. Always have the end in sight and know where you’re going.  We also talked about networking.

This group of women were all extremely different, but surprisingly had similar things to say, especially about integrity. What they said really resonated with me. Integrity is something that I believe cannot be compromised. These women also believed that and taught our leadership class about how to keep our integrity. We should lead by example, treat others how we want to be treated, and must always be aware of the right decision, not the easy one. This all may seem like common sense, but it's not that simple.

However, if the situation does arise it is important to remain calm under pressure. Leaders are faced with important decisions every day. Whether it is deciding to take on a new project or address employee performance, it's important to consider your surroundings, as well as your strengths and weaknesses. Each situation has multiple solutions with their own consequences, Leaders need to be able to assess a situation quickly and critically, and decide on the best course of action.

“Taking your place at the table” was one of the topics discussed by panelists. They encouraged us to never be afraid to take a seat at the center, and to break away from our comfort zone. This resonated with me because some of the challenges I face are hesitating to speak up, taking risks, and would be someone who gravitated towards the outskirts of a table.

I have learned to always go out of my way to accommodate guests and make sure they have a positive dining experience. I have noticed that teamwork is most used and appreciated during the busier hours. When co-workers appear to be very busy and overwhelmed, I do my best to help out by clearing their tables, checking on their guests, and running their food. I always ask others what I can do to help them, especially if I am not busy doing something on my own. By helping others, it is more likely that they will help me when I am in need. This promotes a positive work and employee environment. Often times, there are angry, hungry guests that are upset about waiting too long for a table, having their food brought out wrong, etc. In these situations, I’ve learned to problem solve by communicating the issue and providing a straightforward solution, such as a quick re-make, a discount, or coupons for future visits. Most often, excuses are not necessary. The key is to resolve the issue quickly. As a server, there is always something that needs to be done. One table needs to be greeted, one table needs their check, on table needs a side of ranch, etc. There is an ongoing list of things that need to be done and done quickly.

Second, he stressed the fact that it does not take money to build something you believe in. You should be willing to reach out and communicate; get advice, network, and get traction to build your venture. Third, it doesn’t matter where you are. College students have so many resources at their fingertips, you can try many things while at school and fail as many times as you want. Every time you try and fail, you learn something new and it further develops your business knowledge. The last thing Ted spoke about is entrepreneurship.

We had a total of $500,000 to trade with and due to my interest in the markets and competitive nature, I had a return of over 12% last week, ranked 20 out of a class of 177, and had made all the trades needed for the assignment. I was even going to get an extra point for beating the S&P 500, currently at 3.27%. 

At that point, I could've played it safe and stopped trading after completing all of the necessary trades, but I was incentivized by the other extra point for those that make the top 10% of the class and I wanted to get to the top of the board. I knew I had to make a risky bet to get the high returns I wanted and all I had to lose was one extra credit point. So I immediately bought Netflix call options on Monday, expecting prices to go up once their earning report came out after the markets closed that day. Tuesday morning, I was sitting at negative 6% because their prices had fallen.

Before you approach any investors, make sure you are practicing your pitch and you have a formulated plan. He said it is important now all the details inside and out. The plan will have set goals and the means to achieve that. When speaking with potential investors  they will ask more and more questions so they can see cracks in the business. Make sure you maintain leverage; do not reveal all your cards up front, you may come off desperate. It is important to gauge the interest of the party so you know when to reveal a certain aspect. Finally he emphasized that you remain calm. He spoke of a Goldman Sachs interview where the manager pulled out a newspaper and started reading it during his pitch. They were testing his stress level.

He then talked about the concept behind MedExpress and how he found a gap in the market and filled it. Again, I don't really understand the medical community and I know very little about healthcare but from what Frank talked about, I am impressed with how he managed to start his business. It was inspirational to see a friendly family man talk about how passionate he is about helping people. He also talked a little bit about angel investors and potentially selling his company but he did not give too many details about those topics. I think the best part of the entire discussion was when Frank talked about how much work and effort he had put into starting and expanding MedExpress. He really sold the point that if you have an idea, put as much time and energy into it as you can and you too can become a big success.

Car insurance, cell phone plan, car, rent, all the stuff behind the scenes you should already have ready before you start work.

Reflection

As part of the Professional Development Committee, I’ve had the opportunity to work on my presentation skills. I’ve presented to members of the club on the following topics: social media, LinkedIn, and interviewing tips for the career fair. As treasurer of the club, I’ve had experience preparing budgets which will help me with my personal finances after college. I now understand how to forecast projected revenues and expenses for the year and how to find new revenue opportunities to continue to grow the club. Also, I have worked on my networking skills by talking to leaders in the sports business industry at weekly meetings. I was a moderator for the Sports Business Club Networking event and hosted employees from ESPN, the Philadelphia Flyers, and IMG Learfield. This club has been influential in helping me develop my presentation, networking, and finance skills moving forward.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Since there is no leadership that has any real power over any of the members, all things that are accomplished by this organization is because the members make it so, not because they have to or because some adult is making them.  Because of this, it is sometimes difficult to get everyone to cooperate towards a mutual goal.  I admit, sometimes I am this person.  Although frustrating at times, it has taught me important skills regarding leadership and teamwork.  In the real world, there will often be goals that require multiple people to achieve.  Just like in the fraternity, they are not always going to be fully cooperative and I will need to better direct them in order to  achieve these goals.

From playing IM soccer I feel that I developed skills in teamwork such as self awareness as to my role, and understanding that what I did on the field affected everyone. While these are certainly concepts I had head of before and understood, it was this activity that made it real for me. I was happy to have an experience like this, because as opposed to track, I felt that my actions mattered much more, and it has given me soft skills that I am sure will continue to benefit me into my sustainable initiatives project, and into my career down the road.

Instead of reports on the state of markets they were more focused and unrelated at the same time.  I distinctly remember, at the first meeting I attended, someone gave a report on the economics of bees, a topic I had never given much thought about.  Although certainly not every presentation was about this same subject, they all were similarly unique.  The nature of these presentations changed my perspective on the nature of economics.  I realized that economics was more than just the nature of money; it was ingrained in every aspect of our life.  This realization both opened up new avenues in my education as well as changing the way I think.  While I apply a new analysis to various fields across the board, I also take what I learn from these fields and apply them to the more classical sense of economics.

As for the case competition itself, our task was to develop a youth sports management website, that would make the method of running a league easier by creating a simple platform.

One time, the snack bar employee I was working with misplaced the order and I served out the wrong dish. The patients families were not happy.

I was tempted to raise my voice back and tell them they should stop being rude toward me, but I knew better. I knew that these families were in a stressful condition and I wanted to make their stay at the hospital as comfortable as possible. So I apologized, went back to the employee and explained her mistake, and the family got the right order.

In detail we looked at two major ways that students use to commute to and from campus; cars and CATA buses. We felt that the number of parking spots wasn't enough, and the inconsistent and overcrowded CATA buses often led to missed classes. However, we knew that asking the transportation department to simply build more parking spots and purchase more buses would be a brash suggestion. Instead we looked at how the current transportation system could be optimized to be more effective.

After creative discussions within the group and with Mr.Robert Demayo, the director of Penn State transportation department, we came up with a solution that seemed doable and beneficial. For one, we asked that the CATA buses be implemented to the Penn State shuttle bus app, which is more accurate and consistent of their shuttles than CATA is of their buses. We also wanted to raise awareness for the shuttle system that many students have not even heard of, to reduce the overall number of cars on campus, which would open up parking spots to those students who need it the most.

To create the site, we are utilizing Wordpress. This is the first time that I, along with several other people in my project group, have worked with Wordpress. We met to discuss changes we would like to make to the site as well as additional features we would like to add. After determining what we want the new site to include, we looked for a theme on Wordpress that could accommodate these features. Each theme on Wordpress has different capabilities and is edited in slightly different ways, which created difficulties. We would find a theme that we would like, begin working with it and start to feel comfortable with it, then realize that that the theme wasn't an appropriate fit. Choosing a theme required a significant amount of patience. It also required teamwork to resolve any issues that we came across. After several days of hard work, we were able to successfully choose a theme and are now pushing forward with the project. I learned that when working on a project for a company, things don't always go right the first time. However, by being patient and utilizing problem solving skills, progress can still be made.

We held surveys, focus groups, and utilized different tools to collect information that helped to shape our application.

As for our meeting, we had to rephrase all the content paragraphs on the page, and redesign the home page to make sure we leave a good first impression on our clients. We wanted the website to reflect what an average day as an intern for Surge looks like, and to do that we had to brainstorm just how we were going to do that. 

So we decided that in the upcoming weeks, we will take pictures of us working rather than using stock images, and that includes a typical meeting for all the projects, working inside the Launchbox, and a brief description for each projects we were working on so our clients can have a general idea of what we do.

So if we were in a meeting for a project and a question comes up that doesn't have a direct answer, a good speaker could tell the black belt story and then tie that into a useful narrative. If it's applicable, these stories can be used to foster trust or expertise, which could give you leverage. Little details about your co-workers can be useful if implemented into a pitch or interview right. If not however, this can look like your babbling on, which can leave a bad taste in their mouth.

Our sales team was getting better at the sales pitch itself, but we realized we were missing couple of things; product sell sheets to guide our buyers through the sales pitch, and business cards to leave a good impression on our professionalism and give them a way to contact us without writing things down at the sales pitch. I took the task of designing both of those through Canva.com.

I haven't designed anything professionally before, but I kept in mind to keep it simple and distinguishable. To do that, I had to think about what makes MyEventBag unique and recognizable. I also had to make sure to match the font and color choices on product sell sheet with the actual product. After trying out multiple layouts and font choices, I decided to go with a simple gray background and a bold font to make it look simple but aesthetic, similar to the product itself.

Through this experience I learned that advertising takes a lot of consideration and it is easy to swerve off if you don't keep the focus on product itself.

We got an hour for each room, so we had to use the limited tools provided to work our way through. We entered the first room then started scanning for any clues we could.

As I was cleaning out the photos on my phone the other night, I was able to relive so many memories that I will hold close to me for the rest of my life.  Through working with Boulevard to better the State College community, I have learned to further value so many experiences and people that I've met along the way during my journey at Penn State.  I am so grateful for the opportunities given to me by Boulevard, which include raising money for THON and working with a number of different organizations including Big Brothers Big Sisters, Lion's Pantry and many others.  I have been able to operate numerous fundraising activities as well as participate in a number of community service events.

I think community service is so valuable and humbling, and it really allows you to take a step back and look at the big picture, while also getting the opportunity to experience the world through the eyes of others.  In the future, I hope to go on mission trips in other countries to further my cultural knowledge and continue traveling the world and seeing things from the perspectives of others.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At first, I thought that I wanted to go into business, so I started taking some business courses  to retain some knowledge. After a semester or two and a GPA lower than I would have wanted, I decided that I wanted to go into IST. Luckily, the business courses were applicable to my new major so I wasn't behind, and I started taking technology courses. I was always fascinated by technology and how it changed our world, so learning how these things worked was awesome. I went through the base classes and did pretty well because I was interested and I would study the material everyday unlike the boring business courses I was taking originally. After a year or so into the program, I knew I was in the right major. i was doing good in my IST classes and I started raising my GPA each semester. As the number classes increased (IST 110, 210, 240) I was learning more in depth topics within the IT world such as coding, database management and router connection. Not only did I learn how more about these topics, a lot of my professors went into great detail about how they worked. A lot of it got pretty complicated, but I studied the difficult material more and continued tackling each class. Now I have two semesters left and about 4 major classes left. These are going to be difficult but I'm ready now.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We were concerned and with everybody in an open setting, tried to figure out how this could have happened.  Ultimately, the task had been delegated to anyone who had an opportunity to do it, but no such instance presented itself.  Whether the failure was in the dissemination, understanding, execution, or a combination of the three was irrelevant; so we regrouped, assessed the situation, and all interns were able to pull together, go through the Prosper Works system and get all follow-up E-mails out before the end of the day, getting us all caught up.  What was most valuable for me in this situation was the opportunity I had to assess a crisis situation (although it certainly could have been worse, this was just the biggest problem we've run into collectively this summer) and figure out which clients were highest priority, explain verbally how we needed to take on this challenge as a team, and then get everyone to execute.  True it would have been better had this situation not happened at all, but we learned from it and are sending out E-mails in a much more timely and organized fashion.
