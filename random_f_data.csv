83,2904,the three of us went to the hub friday night at  to watch the martian  the movie experience was relevant to our course assignment because nearly the entire movie consisted of jpl and nasa working together as a team and recognizing everyones strengths and weaknesses  the skills of creativity and curiosity will definitely aid in the design of this project because we need to think outside the box to design a model that helps explain a topic in a completely new way  selfawareness will also be critical during this team project because you will know your limitations and whom to speak with on their strengths,1,0,0,0,0,psu

85,2850, my team and i watched the movie the martian as part of our first liveit experience each person individually reflected on the movie to post it on our portfolio the astronauts in this movie faced different challenges and they always tried to be calm and think of a solution all their solutions are really practical and simple because when you are in outer space time is of essence and you dont have all the resources you need to come up with a more complex solution i can relate this to my life sometimes you have to complete certain tasks but you dont have all the tools you would like due to economic reasons so you need to figure out simple and practical solutions  the team on earth has additional resources and people to be able to come up with more complex solutions but at the same time they can overlooked the conditions of the crew this happens in real life when management wants something to be done but they dont realize the conditions or the complexity of your job  ,0,1,0,1,0,psu
86,2845,my team and i watched the martian together and enjoyed being in the presence of others that appreciated the problem solving  and ingenuity that was happening on screen  the limited resources and unforgiving circumstances that were given to the protagonists in the film allowed us to observe what amazing things happen everyday because of teamwork  if theoretically i was put in a similar situation i would quickly realize that it could only be through communication dedication and hard work that everyone would be able to accomplish such an undertaking,0,0,0,0,0,psu
87,2834,my team members and i watched the martian for the scifi movie experience this was a fantastic movie the acting from matt damon made it very enjoyable and believable i also liked how the movie greatly applied science to the plot matt damon was able to use his knowledge to continue designing things to solve the problems he faced i think that was the beauty in this movie the visual effects were also fantastic one of my favorite scifi movies matt damon played a botanist using his own knowledge of chemistry and biology he was able to use hydrogen and oxygen to create a continuous source of water through a combustion process after obtaining water he was able to grow potatoes in fertilizer the most impressive part of his survival tactics was how he communicated with the people back on earth he was able to find out where a past rover was on mars he went to obtain it and used its communication systems to talk with earth if i was in this situation i would not have survived,0,0,0,0,0,psu
88,2999,the team and i watched the martian  the astronauts dealt with many challenges by using their knowledge skills and creativity to survive  although the teams on earth performed and worked with the astronauts to return them to safety  mark watney the main character was struck by debris during their evacuation which left him stranded on mars  he then made it his goal to make it home alive  watney a botanist managed to successfully farm on martian soil  next he was able to make contact with the teams on earth  nasa instructed watney to modify a rover so that they could communicate via text  then nasa sent a supply probe to watney which exploded after liftoff due to skipping safety inspections  although the cnsa offered a classified booster to assist in rescuing watney  meanwhile rich purnell an astrodynamicist created a plan to resend the hermes back to mars  nasa rejected the plan  although the astronauts on board willingly accepted  the mission was a success,0,1,1,0,0,psu
89,2929,the martian was a great scifi movie about a team of astronauts who leave one of their teammates on mars after they are forced to leave during an intense storm on mars surface matt damon the character left on mars is then forced to survive on his own until the people on earth can figure out a way to retrieve him while he is on mars he discovers a way to farm potatoes using his own waste as fertilizer so that he does not starve he also designs a contraption that makes water from the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen to ensure that he remains well hydrated at the same time that matt damon is doing all of this the people on earth are trying to figure out how to retrieve him from mars they decide to use earth as a slingshot to send the astronauts back to mars and intercept matt damon in space as they pass by if i were placed in this situation i would try my best to design a contraption to get me home because in that situation you really dont have much to lose ,0,0,0,1,0,psu
90,2967,as a group we watched the martian in which matt damon is stranded on mars during a dust storm that causes the rest of his team to return to earth overall we felt the movie was good but that it was a little too hollywood meaning it tried to be a little too comical sometimes and came across as unrealistic we compared matt damons ingenuity on mars to that of the scientists on earth and concluded they were similar in the challenges they faced ,0,1,0,1,0,psu

92,2874,the martian was a very entertaining and was for the most part scientifically accurate after matt damon was stranded he remained very composed and quickly used his wits to find a way to survive his botany skills were the most significant in extending his lifespan on mars the people on earth also put forth their very best effort in retrieving him as fast as possible they did not think for any second to just leave him there neither side panicked and the way they brought him home safely was an incredible cinematic masterpiece if i were in the situation on mars i dont think i have the knowledge or skills to survive as long as matt damon did or even reestablish communication with earth if i were on earth i think i would fare better because i am working with a team rather than by myself in a survival situation ,0,1,0,1,1,psu

96,2908,our group went to see the martian last week at the hub we all enjoyed the dynamic nature that the movie portrayed for life in space we appreciated the science behind growing food in a place where nothing should grow it was a great display of determination knowledge and a passion for life we disagreed with some of the portrayals of how an engineering unit works however for instance the method of holding meetings and presenting information was not how standard procedures work in the engineering workforce furthermore nasa should have a hierarchical system however in the movie regular scientists interacted freely with the ceo which seems a bit off the experience as a whole was a fantastic bonding experience to get to know one another as well as prime ourselves for the semester ahead the relaxed nature of the event strengthened how our team interacts and will hopefully yield fruitful results as we continue,1,0,0,1,1,psu

98,2907,our  team went to the hub to watch the movie the martian the movie showed how an astronaut faced the difficulties he had after his team have left him back in apollo  space mission the movie illustrates how astronauts are ready for such incidents we also thought that the astronaut showed great resource management skills where he first started by planning whether or not available resources are enough then the astronaut displays creativity since he figured a way to get more resources on the other hand nasa had meetings to try saving the astronaut  where they presented information about space rescue missions moreover something we thought was not common in an engineering work force was that the movie didnt display hierarchical system for instance a regular employee was sitting in the same meeting room with the nasa ceo overall the event made us get to know each other more and strengthen the team bonds,1,1,0,1,0,psu

630,2833,in the movie the martian mark whatney was an astronaut stranded on mars during a sandstorm  he dealt with the situation by calculating how long he has to live and then found ways to extend that time  he first created a system to grow plants for food and then eventually found a way to try to communicate with nasa  its interesting that his background as a botanist was the first helpful skill while on mars  the team on earth was able to anticipate his next steps by watching the satellite and they were able to prepare the communication system  if i were in that situation i probably would not develop such an elaborate farming system first  my first thought would be to find a way to connect the satellite or another form of communication,1,1,0,0,0,psu

790,3314,of the artworks at the palmer museum the one that best represents a challenge i have overcome this year is the blackfoot delegation to washington  this year i had the opportunity to take ced  a class that explored the history and culture of the ojibwe tribe and american indian tribes in general this course was a challenge because it disrupted a previous acceptance of the united states government as a force which treated all its citizens equally of course i knew generally of the sufferings the government had imposed on indians in late history but never before had i been exposed to devastating accounts of indian history in a way that was so detailed and expository every course and assignment forced me to question what could have motivated a country to allow these terrible things to happen to people who had inhabited this land for thousands of years before them  	this sculpture serves as a very literal representation of my struggle,0,1,1,0,0,psu
791,3314,to understand the treatment of indians through american history the positioning of the indians in the front of the sculpture with the white men behind them demonstrates their susceptibility to the authoritative control of white leaders further the dark shadows painted onto the white figures suggest the destruction which they inflicted upon the indians through treaties and legal documents because this sculpture so accurately captures the paternalistic and oppressive role that white leaders played in indian affairs it alludes to the challenge i faced in accepting the extent to which white men corroded indian society certainly it reflects upon the idea that america the great has some explaining to do particularly in regards to the actions of white leaders in the lives of americas indigenous population though it was difficult to break down my biased understandings  this challenge broadened my perspective greatly and i look forward to future challenges at penn state ,0,1,0,0,0,psu

828,3329,in my final task to find a painting that spoke to me on a personal level i discovered sidney goodmans painting august landscape like the other two paintings i chose before it this one is also a landscape yet it differs from the other more realistic paintings because of its somewhat fantastical appearance an ordinary road suddenly appears to end in a giant rocky mountainside that seems to extend far above the flat terrain before it on the mountainside are layer upon layer of rock and multiple ledges upon which different structures sit to me this unusual landscape seems to be a perfect analogy for the journey of life each ledge or rock layer represents an obstacle to be overcome each time we reach one a new challenge a new one presents itself people need to be able to adapt to constantly changing  circumstances the painting itself has no  real limit which suggests that there is no peak or stopping point to life it just continues to place new things in our path ,1,0,0,0,0,psu

840,3315,for my college experience i chose still life with grapes by severin roesen  as depicted above the painting shows a feast of brightly colored fruit  i liked this painting because it made me think of when i started using a meal plan at penn state freshman year  i could not believe how amazing the food in the dining commons was besides just the quality of the food i always ate with my friends  i have had so many good meals on campus with friends each one was a part of my college experience  i am moving off campus next year and i am losing my meal plan  i definitely consider this a part of my overall college experience but the hot prepared meals on my meal plan will definitely be missed  i will also miss the fact that i will be eating less with my friends  my hope is that i will use this as an opportunity to train my cooking skills and have friends over for meals but it is much easier to make ramen than it is to make a real meal  i am sure there will be many times next year,0,0,0,0,1,psu

847,3291,my original thought was that a personal mission statement should be a couple of sentences long however the longer i thought about it i realized my personal mission could be boiled down to three words passion with integrity there is a growing and disturbing trend to avoid outward passion and feign disinterest in order to appear cool i have always striven to be passionate and ambitious in the things i do i believe that the path to success is paved with enthusiasm in life one needs to find work in areas that they love so that interest and passion is maintained i also try to uphold my personal values while trying to achieve success and happiness integrity is an important moral for me because i believe in being honest both to others and oneself the experience of creating a personal mission statement was a fulfilling exercise in selfdiscovery i was required to critically examine my motivations and what drives me  ,0,1,0,0,0,psu

1222,3573,after visiting the palmer art museum the oil canvas painting working horse hauling by kate javens stood out as my spirit paintingthe piece physically stands out by its massive size as you go to the second floor of the museum but i related to the picture after hearing the story behind italthough it shows a horse it is meant to represent a person named mary harrisshe was a labor organization activist mainly known for her childrens crusadeto help establish child labor lawsi related to her because for the past six years i have dedicated all of my free time to working with four diamonds to help in the fight for a cure for pediatric cancerthe grittydark colors javens used brings out emotions both of our situations evokefighting against several opposing forces for an important causethe hard working atmosphere portrayed is relatable to the hundreds of hours i have put into the effortoverall i had a very thoughtprovoking experience  found several interesting pieces of art,1,0,0,0,0,psu

1429,3523,one of the most intriguing topics i have been lucky to learn about this year was the strengths finder many women are aware of their weaknesses who isnt not many women are aware of their strengths knowing our strengths is so important in daily life when interviewing and especially when trying to be a leader this strengths finder presentation not only showed me specifically what my strengths are but highlighted the importance of knowing them and using them to my advantage for example my top strength is achiever i know that i work hard for things in my life but i never would have categorized that as my top strength now i can knowing this allows me to implement it for future use for example when i interview with someone i will weave in my strengths throughout my answers before this presentation i wouldnt have known to do that but now it makes complete sense being aware of these strengths allows me to make other people aware of them as well and helps me stand out ,0,1,0,0,0,psu
1430,3512,before the weekend workshop with wli i had to complete the strengths finder  assessment  during the assessment i felt quite overwhelmed by how fast the questions were coming and going and how this would impact my results  during the sunday of the weekend workshop i was given the opportunity to reflect on my top five strengths and make connections to them in my leadership style  my top strength was empathy which at first made me feel like a weak leader  however the description given for empathy discussed how this strength deals with keeping the peace in the group  i realized that this strength fit me rather well because i am always the one who would rather others be happy in order to keep a positive group atmosphere  i see myself using this skill in my current jobs and will definitely allow it to grow and prosper as i take on new challenges and work in more diverse groups  as an individual aspiring to be a physician assistant i can always use empathy when working with my patients to help them feel understood as well as working with my coworkers and boss to help keep harmony in the workplace,0,0,0,0,0,psu

1435,3485,one course topic from the fall semester that i specifically enjoyed was the success principles session led by stephanie mazzeocaputo many of her theories and advice towards being a successful leader were very applicable to now and future ventures a few of her success principles i plan on using included building a strategy pyramid building a belief in myself and investing in the process not in the outcome firstly building a strategy pyramid is a useful skill that allows thoughts and ideas for how to accomplish a common goal to be written down on paper it makes the process clearer to everyone and clearly represents what the plan is this tool can also be used whenever whether building a strategy for how i want to study or just using it in a group project everything written down in advance provides a path to lead the way building a belief in yourself and others helps everyone do their best and feel their best when working together which is essential for any interaction with others lastly investing in the process by spending the majority of the time focused on the journey to reach the end goal instead of just the end goal theres more room for improvement along the way implementing these things now and in the future will allow me to be a more successful leader to both my team and myself through the use of these three main ideas applied every day i can continually build my skills and improve who i am as a leader,1,0,0,1,1,psu

1438,3531,after reflecting on my journey through the penn state womens leadership initiative thus far i have come to realize that i have learned so much about leadership professional development and most important myself i have grown as a leader and as a young woman ready to enter the real world with my head held high and arms wide open welcoming new opportunities and people that come my way as a young leader i think it is critical to be selfaware and making a conscious effort everyday to improve myself the session that helped me the most in my development as a leader was the strengthsfinder presentation by dr alyssa brooks  as a leader it is necessary to be aware of my strengths and weaknesses however i chose the strengthsfinder over the myersbriggs because personally i focus too much on my weaknesses the test i did to find my strengths the results i received and the presentation given by dr brooks really opened my eyes to what i have to give to a group as a leader and how to hone in on those strengths to be the best i can be it sometimes takes an outside perspective to make me aware of what my strengths are and that they are valued and needed becoming aware of my strengths through wli has had a positive impact on my personal and professional development as well as my self esteem the womens leadership initiative has helped build my confidence and that is something that is truly rewarding i am so grateful what i have learned and the impact it has had on me as a young woman and a leader ,0,0,0,0,1,psu

1441,3476,one of the most memorable lessons i have learned in wli has been conflict resolution the conflict cycle starts with the problem then perception followed by feelings identified then the response and lastly outcome being able to handle conflict calmly and collectively shows leadership and will hopefully deepen the relationship one has with another the selftest on conflict management styles told me i conciliate essential i solve problems by finding the middle ground where both parties involved are willing to work together to negotiate or at least come to an understanding no one likes conflict but the way one approaches conflict is what makes the difference in the future i plan on applying this to my career as a physical therapist when a conflict occurs amongst my colleagues or even my patients i will do my best to make sure all those involved get to share their feelings and can come to a fair resolution ,0,1,0,0,1,psu

1664,3492,after listening to the first session of panelists in harrisburg on march  i have learned some of the most crucial aspects when it comes to applying and maintaining a career one panelist who especially caught my attention was dr lauren hughes not only did she gain a whole slew of experience in the medical field but now she works in politics regularly visits harrisburg to work and supervises many employees the main point she discussed that really stuck out to me was how employers hire for attitude and teach for skill she said that when she looks to hire new employees she can tell right off the bat whether or not they would be a good fit physical skills required for the job can always be taught but teaching someone how to act professionally politely and respectfully qualities of professionalism are developed overtime and are just as important if not more important than tangible skills needed for a job the panelist speakers especially dr lauren hughes really emphasized the importance of acting professionally in the workplace,0,0,0,0,0,psu

1679,3496,during the issues facing young leaders panel there was a lot of focus on being flexible in your career path many of the panelist spoke about how they imagined their education and career in one way and the actual path that they took was a totally different course whether it was not being accepted at a collegeuniversity accepting an undesirable job or accepting a job in which the role is unfamiliar or unknown each panelist discussed the importance of embracing these diversions because there is potential for more growth than following a set path this was a different concept for me a very structured organized and planned individual when i first started thinking about this idea the unknown aspects of being flexible made me anxious and uneasy as i continued to think more about this idea i realized that i have already experienced a lot of this in my life as i have started and almost finished college the divergent path that i have followed so far has given me opportunities that i would have never dreamed to be possible as a young leader i need to enable opportunities that promote flexibility in order to make the most of every situation that i encounter as i continue to learn flexibility i am excited for all of unforeseen opportunities to come ,1,1,1,0,0,psu

1697,3523,i believe a leader is someone who motivates a group of people to accomplish a certain goal great leaders dont have to be in a specific field they dont have to have a certain personality they dont all lead the same way but they do all have very similar thoughts on integrity i learned all of this from our trip to harrisburg where we were able to have meaningful interactions with todays government leaders this group of women were all extremely different but surprisingly had similar things to say especially about integrity what they said really resonated with me integrity is something that i believe cannot be compromised these women also believed that and taught our leadership class about how to keep our integrity we should lead by example treat others how we want to be treated and must always be aware of the right decision not the easy one this all may seem like common sense but its not that simple these women have had to develop these skills and work at them until they are the best leaders they could be  one of the best things i heard from this leadership weekend was from one of our speakers the mayor of york although not directly related to integrity it really touched my heart we should want to live in a world where firsts dont exist i dont want to celebrate the first woman president or the first gay judge i want to live in a world where these are common happenings and always accepted every type of person should have the same chances ,0,0,1,0,1,psu
1698,3486,the young leader panel during our weekend workshop on march  taught me a lot about what to expect as a young leader it seems intimidating to enter the workforce after graduation especially in a field such a nursing where it is commonly stated that established nurses arent always receptive to new employees the women on this panel all emphasized the importance of asserting yourself and being confident sometimes even creating your own opportunities when one isnt presented to you lauren s an rn stated that the biggest challenge for young leaders is needing to prove ourselves time and time again in order to do that you need to know your selfworth and be confident in your capabilities that can include forcing yourself to talk to others promoting encouragement for those below you and avoiding the workplace gossip and negativity a quote from lauren that really stuck with me was dont be overwhelmed by what everyone else is doing  everything happens for a reason it can be a let down to not get the internship or job you wanted but it doesnt mean you wont be good at what you do as a leader i hope to act as a role model and lead by example and also be open to new opportunities even if it wasnt my initial option i feel more equipped to be a young leader after this session and these women prove that you can be a leader even if you are surrounded by others with more experience,0,1,0,0,0,psu

1702,3526,during my time in harrisburg i gained invaluable advice on how to handle myself in the workplace the ethics in leadership panel especially stuck with me as it largely focused on the importance of attitude both in life and the workplace it reaffirmed my belief that in order to succeed in a career it is important to know your core moral compass and stick to your gut to follow such a compass as well as how important it is to act with integrity an interesting way to look at integrity that spoke to me is that it is easier to maintain  of the time rather than  that way everyone knows what they get with you and one cannot feel trapped to make exceptions for a person after the initial one the most important lesson i gained from the entire panel however was that most employers hire for attitude and character because skills can be taught a second point to this statement was faking your way through your job doesnt work so its easy to be honest about your level of skill this was a valuable lesson to me because it showed me that being honest and personable will get you a lot farther in the workplace than starting off with the highest level of skill in the office which i think is a very important lesson that goes untaught with a lot of young adults trying to make it in their workplace,0,0,0,0,1,psu

1836,4045,yesterday me and most of the other interns got together for a little gettogether to hang out and to learn things about each other though it was a lot of fun there was some utility to the night and there were things learned that could be used for example morgan pointed out yesterday that she was counting all the people in the group that were black belts on some discipline and we found that four of us share that in common information of this kind might seem to be just useless information but a good leader or speaker could take these experiences and relate them to the present so if we were in a meeting for a project and a question comes up that doesnt have a direct answer a good speaker could tell the black belt story and then tie that into a useful narrative if its applicable these stories can be used to foster trust or expertise which could give you leverage little details about your coworkers can be useful if implemented into a pitch or interview right if not however this can look like your babbling on which can leave a bad taste in their mouth this bonding between coworkers can also to trust among one another if you learn their speech patterns delivery body language improving on the spot becomes easier because more knowledge is known being able to flow between to your coworkers in dialogue takes practice and doing so well conveys a very strong message to the person on the other side of the table that you work well which again produces trust ,0,0,0,0,1,psu

1861,4112,during my internship yesterday we went to iq escape room state college this was the first time i had ever been to an escape room the one we went to had two rooms stealing mona and contagion unlike other escape rooms the goal was not to escape the room each of the rooms had a mission we had to complete in one hour or less in escape rooms there are tools that are hidden throughout the room that must be collected and used there are also a series of actions that must be done to finish the mission since we have twelve interns at surge we were broken up into two groups my group was composed of five people with two people having gone to an escape room before the first room we did was contagion and we finished with eight minutes remaining the second room we did was stealing mona and we finished with one minute and twenty seconds remaining we were really feeling the pressure during the last five minutes of stealing mona but we dealt with this pressure well the key to our success was listening to each other and trying any ideas that we came up with minus a couple ideas thought of when we started getting desperate instead of having a team leader we let whoever had the idea lead that stage of the mission everyone did their best to contribute at all stages this experience really demonstrated to me the importance of listening to all input and getting everyone involved ,0,1,0,1,0,psu
1862,4045,this past tuesday me and my interns went to an escape room about a mile from the office at first i had no idea what an escape room was but when we arrived we were shown an intro that explained the plots of both the rooms essentially we had to use teamwork to collect clues from the room to advance on toward the end both teams are supposed to compete against each other for the better score so we had to figure out a game plan we got an hour for each room so we had to use the limited tools provided to work our way through we entered the first room then started scanning for any clues we could after some tension we got to the end and unfortunately we ran out of our hour of time i think this happened because we were disorganized we didnt have much of a game plan going in and it showed when we started we went to the second room and discussed what we would do before we went in each of us wanted to work on something separate so we didnt get in each others way doing this and constantly talking throughout the process helped us to make much more progress than the first room we worked through the room and completed it with about two minutes to spare since we didnt complete the first room and the other team completed both they won there was no real prize but we were invited back to test the new room when its finally complete this experience taught me that teamwork is the most important tool for these rooms when we were apart we failed together we won,0,1,0,0,0,psu
1863,4214,this week we had an amazing team building experience called the iq escape room the basic idea of the experience was that we were given two different scenarios to try and solve  with in one hour with the winning team getting a special prize the experience improved the bond between our team of interns the puzzles in the first scenario was about trying to find the antidote  for a virus that has wiped out most of the earth the second one was about replacing the mona lisa painting with a fake one my team won overall i think it was because of the calmcool and collective group we were  having these traits helped with solving the problems that came up in both scenarios overall this experience really helped with timing and team work that i felt i need to improve on ,0,1,0,0,0,psu

1885,4377,risk taking and celebrating noble failure nbsp during our  week trip to tanzania my team had to live with ambiguity our primary goal was to interview people on their thoughts about glasses for around the first  weeks due to restrictions on research involving humans and the irb process we could not ask questions involving opinions during that time i did not know if we would get permission before the end of the  weeks  nbsp but we did not let this fear of failing our goal stop us from making progress we worked hard to create interview questions that were only factbased with the help of our  professors we were able to identify local optical shops and other professors of the nelson mandela institute to talk to when we went into optical shops and spoke to strangers we did not know how they would react to us at first i was apprehensive about approaching people but soon i found that everyone we spoke to was friendly  nbsp on certain days we did not have any set plans we would not know who else to talk to or what else to do this led us to wait for hours for something to happen on several of those days we would be sitting around and suddenly our professor would bring a useful and wellconnected professor to us i was not used to the way we made progress i would worry while we waited because we would not be doing much but when our professor introduced us to a new person that person would introduce us to more people and we would quickly make a lot of progress this experience taught me that the act of waiting for the right moment is worth my time  nbsp on other days certain organizations we wanted to meet would not respond to us in time we never let this deter us when we could not meet with one organization we would start looking for the next by the time we were allowed to ask opinionbased questions we were ready in the end we achieved our primary goal we gathered data from  individual interviews spoke to workers in  optical shops several entrepreneurial professors and technology business owners  nbsp during the  weeks in tanzania i did not know if i would ever get to interview enough people with my team before i believed that sitting around was the same thing as failing to make progress now i know this ldquofailurerdquo to make constant progress helped lead us to our success one reason we were successful is because the downtime allowed us to carefully prepare for our next moves and interview questions ,0,0,0,0,0,psu
1886,4374, several instances come to my mind when i think about noble failure and risk taking being involved in the hese program has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences i have been involved in within the hese program i have taken a few risks and i have failed these failures have helped me learn better and reflect on better ways to approach a problem nbsp the first noble failure i experienced was in engr  i had never taken a class like this one before where i had to think about effective ways to help developing communities and learn from them in engr  i chose to work on a project related to the standardization of mushroom growing facilities in cambodia the first few weeks were challenging as i had never learned about understanding the context social cultural political of a country to solve a problem as engineers we are often taught to do the lsquomathrsquo and come up with the technical solutions it is very rare that we are taught about understanding the people we are designing forwith it was a mindset that was a little bit hard to move away from  nbsp one noble failure i can remember with this class was with the presentations we had to give throughout the semester my team was often not ready and lacked important information when it came time to answering questions from the judges we all had busy schedules and could never converge our thoughts into a coherent presentation this often showed in the quality of our presentations a time when i took a risk and failed was with the first presentation i was one of the students presenting and it didnrsquot go as well as i would have hoped at the end of the presentation my team and i could not answer a lot of questions about cambodia and its context we were missing key information and our value proposition was fuzzy it was the first time i had to present information in such a manner and i failed  nbsp another time where i took a risk and experience failure was with our presentation about the technology i was in charge of designing the standardized mushroom facility in autocad and none of the judges liked the design i took a risk with the design but it didnrsquot turn out well since it was a technology driven presentation we had a hard time convincing the audience of the validity of our work we had to redo the presentation and present at a different time  nbsp another presentation we failed to put together was about the business model for our mushroom growing facility none of us knew how to do financial spreadsheets we had a hard time finding costs of goods that would be necessary to build the facility we had to improvise and use us prices also we had to do a projection sheet where we had to show the number of facilities we were going to sell and when we would make a profit we took a risk by trying to put this information together but we failed our business model was also flawed because we couldnrsquot determine a realistic target market for our product at the end of each presentation when it came time to answering questions about the project we often gave contradicting answers one thing that i have learned about taking risk and failing is that there is a learning curve one can fail seven times but has to stand up eight nbsp,0,0,0,1,0,psu
1887,4379,when i travelled to tanzania my team and i went with a plan we spent many weeks preparing and designing a technology that we believed would work when we arrived on site and spoke with the local people we realized that they did not have the resources we needed to build and further develop our technology they were unfamiliar with the processes we had chosen and we faced a cross roads do we pivot and change our design in order to build something do we stay our course and try to alter the views traditions and common practices of the people we were trying to engagenbsp we had many discussions about what to do it is hard to decide whether to take a risk and try something completely new and different from your plan after hours of thinking and debating we realized that we had to adapt to our settings and alter our designs it would have been ridiculous and disrespectful to come into an unknown setting and try to change one of the building blocks of a culture it is important to listen to the other people you are working with and take their concerns into consideration for a group of multicultural people to work together there has to be mutual respect and active listeningnbsp based on these conversations we changed our design from rammed earth walls which would have required molds rammers and education to hydraform brick walls the hydraform bricks are still made of earthen material that will help to insulate the building from connections with our partners on the ground we were able to hire masons who were familiar with working with the hydraform bricks to build our structure the masons allowed us to build the majority of the structure properly in about  days compared to the  days we expected to use with the rammed earth process  at this point we believed our risky decision would pay off there was an air of optimism and excitement we soon realized that though our structure was built we werenrsquot able to build a flat roof because of the bricks that problem could have been fixed but we furthermore did not have enough wood to finish framing the windows and doors of the structure with inadequate framing we were unable to complete the entire structure when we left arusha tanzania we left our partners with an unfinished structure that does not extend the shelf life of produce  we were unable to give our customers the product we promised and that they desired which led to a noble failure we tried to do the ethical thing by listening to the concerns of the local community and use local suppliers and builders for all of our construction needs unfortunately due to the change in plans and inability to do more indepth planning we had incorrect calculations and made many mistakes                   normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         wlsdexception lockedfalse     name,0,0,1,0,1,psu
1888,4372,initiative is a word that carries a lot of weight in american culture it denotes disciplined decision making in real time when no one else is willing to step up and deliver initiative possesses a sense of urgency not a frantic urgency but a necessary one  nbsp when i traveled to tanzania i noticed two distinct cultural differences that altered my perception of what it meant to take initiative first i observed that the concept of deadlines and timeliness did not matter very much in the arushan context there is a ubiquitous adage in our country that says time is money and money is time americans are obsessed with the passage of time in arusha people are not nearly as worried about the ticking of a clock second it became readily apparent that in this local context people were approachable and eager to help this fact is not to insinuate that americans are not approachable and eager to help however if my team and i were to walk up to random penn state students and state college residents and ask them questions about eyewear it is very likely our response rate would be much lower than it was at the nelson mandela african institute of science and technology nbsp the reason i am taking the time to highlight these cultural differences is because taking initiative means something inherently different in other contexts taking initiative in arusha meant finding a ride into town and asking factbased questions to several optometrists without an approved irb one could describe this as ldquodisciplined decision making in real time when no one else is willing to step up and deliverrdquo and in a sense that is precisely what it was truthfully however the team and myself were fortunate to have found our selves in such a unique context that could allow for such a change of direction  nbsp our irb troubles stemmed from penn state bureaucracy back home we found ourselves stuck in a completely new context with our one major research tool no longer at our disposal luckily for us both of our professors were seasoned researchers and told us that we could still ask questions devoid of opinions as soon as we heard of this loophole we seized upon the opportunity immediately hurrying to write and compile a list of questions to ask our audience nbsp it took the team hours but we were all thankful we had decided to create them by the time we had finished the following day we went into arusha and asked several optometrists our questions and began to compile data even with no irb the process of researching our topic began unfettered the team continued using these nonopinionated questions for almost a week continuing to collect data thankfully the irb was approved toward the end of this long week so we could begin to gather opinionbased information it is important to note that if the team had not taken it upon itself to adapt and persevere while it waited for approval an entire week of research would never have been collected nbsp the biggest surprise of this whole experience is how well it worked out in the end for the vision team taking initiative especially when the going gets rough may seem imperfect at first once you keep going however the world has a funny way of working its problems out in miraculous ways it is important never to give up and become discouraged when things begin to go astray from the original plan staying positive and thinking about how one can best adapt to the changes occurring around them will eventually work the problem out nbsp               normal                  false   false   false      enus   ja   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     style definitions  tablemsonormaltable 	msostylenametable normal 	 	 	msostylenoshowyes 	 	msostyleparent 	    	 	 	msopaginationwidoworphan 	 	fontfamilycambria 	msoasciifontfamilycambria 	msoasciithemefontminorlatin 	msohansifontfamilycambria 	msohansithemefontminorlatin     i started this post by stating that initiative is an impact word in american culture travelling to arusha certainly changed my perception of what the word means in varying contexts but it certainly did not change its inherent importance no matter where one goes in world initiative must be taken and almost invariably if one does decide to do so it tends to work outsomehowin their favor,0,0,0,0,0,psu
1889,4373,nbspinitiativenbsp the word initiative is a word commonly used in entrepreneurship by the book or google engine search it is described as ldquothe power or opportunity to act or take charge before others dordquo this noun carries a lot of weight within the entrepreneurship community and within the social entrepreneurship community through every hese course i have had to exert some level of initiative independently or within a team one example i will have for a lifetime is traveling to tanzania the semester prior to travelling we worked diligently in teams to assess and provide a solution for a problem faced by tanzanians the team i worked with was tasked with eye care we wanted to take advantage of a rising technology  printing we hoped to  print a complete set of eye glasses priced significantly below the rest of the market by definition we were taking initiative we saw an opportunity to take charge before others did on paper it seemed we were doing the exact venture at the exact time when i and the team arrived in tanzania we saw shortly after the word initiative was going to take a different form  printing was not as accessible or prominent in the region the printers we did see where not the printers we would need to complete the lenses we felt pushed up against a brick wall we had done our due diligence upon arriving but what we had anticipated about their culture was wrong this example is similar to that provided by dr esther obonyo ldquomy friend tells an interesting story about a a team of mzungu entrepreneurs who had traveled to a a village in african country to explore opportunities for addressing a social problem using ventures they were there for  weeks during that time they noticed that the women were walking  miles every afternoon to go collect water the mzungu entrepreneurs decided that they needed to focus on an access to water venture which would cut down the travel time for the women to maximum  minutes they raised funding for the venture then went back to the village to set up their venture they went back home after a year they came back to see how things were going and to their surprise the women were not using their solution they were still walking  miles every day the well was working just fine but the women told them this we like walking  miles because it gives us a chance to discuss our husbands and all the other things that are frustrating us nbsp a group of american saw a problem from their perspective and tried to solve it without learning about the culture they only studied the problem and how to solve that specific problem  through both my personal experience and the example above the word initiative is not the definition i initially provided it has transformed into lsquothe power or opportunity to learn and develop an understanding of culture norms values of a community before others dorsquo what both group of americans failed to do is see the value the venture would have for the people from their perspective we thought  printers would work because they worked for us that was wrong if we had dropped  printers the software and an instruction book off came back in a year they would most likely have dust on them nbsp to us technology is advancing rapidly what is new now will be junk within a year or less  printing is going to become a technology that advances faster than people can buy it and put it to use they can be useful in any context but there has to be a true value or else it is useless often times we see what we donrsquot need ie clothes and old cell phones as junk so we donate them to ldquohelprdquo someone else we never stop to think that the people receiving these may think they are junk too we see them as in need and we think what we once valued will be the same for those who get it second hand through this blog post i learned that to help people you have to understand who they are and how they live you can only do that by taking initiative

1891,4371,last semester when me and my group of colleagues were given the topic of our venture at first of course we were all excited because deep down we all share a common passion for helping those in need although we knew what we wanted to do at the time we lacked he intuition to execute our ideas mainly because we didnrsquot exactly know where or how to start after much talk and outside of class meetings we were still at ground zero without a clue of how to approach such general topic of creating an alternative method for the people in tanzania to store their produce using natural systems like solar panels natural ventilation and underground cooling systems it was within one of our outside of class meeting that we just decided to take the initiative to jump in head first and do the research on different types of cooling systems to get a better understanding of what we wanted our venture to model after after a couple of weeks of rigorous research we approached our professor with what we had and she told us that we were missing the bigger picture that in order to figure out what the people needed we first have to figure out what was the root of the problem that we needed numbers to prove why our venture would work as appose to those that have tried and fail at first her comments were a bit discerning because it meant again we would have to start from ground zero which wasnrsquot something any of us looked forward to when our group meet again we thought about the points the professor had made and it all made sense so we focused our energy on those specific topics she listed later on in our venture we incorporated our previous research and realized how all the pieces fell into place taking the initiative at first may seem a bit scary because as humans we are prone to fear the unknow but with a little patience and enough determination it proved to be worthwhile ,1,0,1,0,0,psu
1892,3310,personally i would consider myself to be motivated to take action i easily get bored and like to get my hands dirty rather than sit back and observe while i think it is good to be motivated to start working at the same time this trait can have some negative consequences if i am overambitious to get things started and just get my hands dirty i can sometimes miss the bigger picture of why irsquom so eager to get started and whether or not irsquom prepared to be of assistance relentless motivation to jump in and get started and the lack of any motivation to dive into work are two negative ends of the dichotomy so i hope to continue to work on finding that balance digging deeper this desire to jump in to new activities and take initiative stems from my natural desire to learn new things ndash especially when it comes to little life hacks or smarter ways to work nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp being someone who doesnrsquot like to just sit back and observe my tendency to jump in really took hold of me during the first day of our field work in arusha a new landscape a new community a virgin jobsite and not much information about what was happening really made we worried what am i going to do to help if i have no clue whatrsquos going on all i knew was that a group of workers were preparing a kale field in order to build a foundationhellip there must be a way for me to help nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp as our group stood around observing the work being done i started itching to hop in and help out so i walked over to one of the workers and asked if i could help of course i speak very little swahili and he very little english so the conversation more or less becomes some pointing motioning and confusion on my end after working through our language barrier and consulting with some of the workers who better spoke english i was off to work ndash spooling twine on a stick that would be used to mark out the perimeter of the foundation i think another reason for me taking this initiative to get to work was to overcome an internal and external stereotype of being a lazy mzungu white person i wanted to make a good first impression that i took initiative and was a hard worker by stepping in and getting to work with the crew nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp this practice in taking initiative brought with it both positive and negative side effects on the positive side i got to learn a lot of applicable skills when preparing foundations and also grew a good report with the workers on the flip side irsquom not sure if my help and the help of my classmates who joined in was efficient in forwarding the project our original initiative led us down a daily routine of manual labor much of which could have just been performed by the workers who were much more skilled than us to my surprise i fully realized through this practice of taking initiative that sometimes it is not best to lend a hand while we built a strong relationship with the workers at the same time we spent a lot of time on work that we werenrsquot necessarily there to do instead of performing manual labor we could have been focused more on researching the local brick industry or exploring ways to start a business in tanzania nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp although i do not think my route of action and taking initiative led to the best end i am happy that i stepped in to help and through that formed a positive relationship with the workers ndash who later came to assist us later on our trip when we needed their expertise in leveling the foundation and laying bricks                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 wlsdexc,0,0,1,0,0,psu
1893,4379,taking initiative can take many forms from reading ahead in a class to starting your own business for me it took a couple days of failure and the realization that time was running out to start taking the initiative to move my research forward while i was in tanzania our plan was to build a cold room and test the thermal capacity of the structure in order to prove that it could elongate the shelf life my team and i had a long list of measurements we intended to take five days into our threeweek trip we hadnrsquot even started construction on the building and were beginning to lose hope we had to reevaluate our plans and find a way to make the most out of our trip this lead us to the conclusion that we need to pivot and balance our time between the construction project and research  the research we intended to complete included understanding the entrepreneurship culture the agriculture tasks and overall perception of our proposed venture to accomplish this research we began by creating a list of questions that we would like to ask people we reviewed these questions with our advisors and professors to ensure that all of the questions followed protocol and would not skew our results we were still lacking the initiative to fulfill the accomplishment of our informal research  a few more days in we had finally begun construction on the site yet had refrained from making progress on our research it was at this point that my team and i knew something had to be done we reached out to our professors who connected us with some people that we then set up meetings with these conversations led to other connections and names for us to further research i believe that we really began making progress after these initial meetings it was at this time that we took accountability into our own hands and began browsing online for organizations in the local area that were involved in the same space whether that be agricultural or entrepreneurial with those searches we began to independently reach out to them one experience that really resonated with me was our work with the world vegetable centre  we found the world vegetable centre online through a google search i then proceeded to call and ask for an appointment on the same day because we were leaving to return to the united states the following day i had no idea how they would respond to our request but i made sure to indicate our legitimacy through a brief explanation of our project and the work we have accomplished over our trip they were interested in hearing more about our project and agreed to meet with us that same day when we visited the world vegetable center they took us on a tour of their offices and prototyping facilities their facilities included a functional subset dedicated to reducing post harvest losses the very core of our project our tour guides reviewed the status and partners for each of their postharvest projects interestingly enough some of the projects they reviewed with us had been solutions we had previously reviewed before determining to pursue a cold room venture nbspthe tour guides were extremely influential in helping us understand the success and failure modes of those projects with all of this additional information on the local context we were able to evaluate our cold room with a different perspective i believe that it was this specific experience that could be the root cause of realizing that our cold room project would not be a successful venture despite the technological advancements it incorporated it is experiences and conversations like these that can only occur during in country assignments these experiences lead us to pivoting and continuing to improve our ventures through the entrepreneurship wheel i think that if my group and i had not made the decision to change our plan on the ground and take the initiative to search out new connections in arusha we would have lost valuable time this semester pursuing a course that is unviable from this adventure i learned that taking the initiative is vital to progressing any type of project and venture nbsp                  normal                  false   false

1894,4374, a time i exhibited an ability to take initiative was this summer when we traveled to tanzania traveling to tanzania was an opportunity to learn more about the context of the country and consolidate or dismiss the information we had gathered during the spring semester the trip was also about testing the validity of our project the project we worked on during the spring semester was about addressing the issue of post harvest loss by designing a solar cold room facility that would allow farmers to extend the shelf life of their produce and better time the market  nbsp during the first few days of our trip we were organizing the tasks we wanted to accomplish in order to have a meaningful experience one of the first tasks we wanted to complete was to be able to talk to local farmers on the ground we didnrsquot know how were going to do this but we kept our eyes peeled for an opportunity nbsp during the first week in tanzania we focused our efforts on building our cold room during the second week we were able to establish an initial contact with farmers near the construction site we noticed that there were a lot of crops grown around the site and asked who the owners were we started to realize that farmers were living in the area we were building we kept asking if we could talk to one of them  nbsp we were able to start conversations within a matter of two days we were happy to hear about the farmersrsquo perspectives on the farming practices in tanzania however one issue we encountered was the language barrier none of us knew how to speak swahili and the farmers didnrsquot know how to reply in english this is when we took the initiative to ask one of the masons we were working with while building our structure if he could translate our questions and help us in the process a mason agreed to help us and we were able start a conversation although we still had a few translation barriers we were able to catch most of the content that was provided to us the information that the farmers gave us allowed us to start analyzing some of the issues farmers were having with respect to their crops and think about the appropriateness of our solution discussing with them was a way to validate our technology and not simply push a technology on them  nbsp another outcome of this story was that the next day a local general manager for all farms in the region came and talked to us at the site the manager was fluent in english and kindly proposed to help us answer additional questions he clarified many of the answers provided by the farmers and answered questions that allowed us to broaden our understanding of the problem  nbsp taking the initiative to ask for translation gave us an outcome that was unexpected but positive being able to talk to local farmers opened a few doors for us we didnrsquot know were there before taking some initiative during our trip made me realize that asking for help or asking a simple question can lead to more opportunities the answer is always no if one never asks even if we had taken the initiative to talk to farmers and had obtained a different outcome it would still be a valuable learning experience  nbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
1895,4401,i was assigned a fairly challenging project when i was in the  grade in my foundations of technology class i had to create a budget and vacation trip itinerary for a preselected city in the united states the projectrsquos objective was to map out an entire route budget plan and list of activities for a trip to las vegas with a budget of  the scope was to make the plan as detailed as possible from the estimated number of times planned for rest stops to the costs of gas and hotels i was given a  window to start and complete the project me and my classmates were informed on a tuesday about the project which was the beginning of the project and were given two weeks to complete the trip layout there wasnrsquot really a timeframe for the project seeing as to how we got the freedom to start the project at any time and complete it within the  period so there werenrsquot selected daytoday tasks for the project i did not have a specific day that i wanted to complete the project by but i had a motive to get it done as soon as possible so i could elaborate on my ideas up until i finally submitted it the resources i used to come with my plan were  electronic and  personal knowledge the majority of my resources were electronic because i used the internet for information on most of the things i needed to know about i tracked hotel prices attraction prices restaurants trip distance etc most of the things i needed to know had to be found through the internet i used my personal knowledge to estimate how often we would stop to eat get gas partake in activities and so onnbsp this project was a bit of a challenge because i had to think critically to ensure i didnt forget anything and make sure that my plan and budget would work i got better at being more detailoriented and patient with doing this project and im glad that i took it on,0,1,1,0,0,psu

1897,4372,my experience with hese could probably best be summarized as a lengthy exercise in adaptability every component of a missionbased venture requires flexibility in its implementation missions are almost by definition nuanced and difficult to complete it has infected the western lexicon as a sort of difficult journey that only the brave embark upon whether it be young religious people traveling to inhospitable areas to spread their faith astronauts plunging deeper into the great beyond or tom cruise doing the impossible on the silver screen missions are often openended arduous and seemingly insurmountable  while a true mission does seem to meet all these criteria successful missionbased ventures do happen all the time albeit at a much slower rate than usual forprofit startups hese is the pursuit of these successful missionbased ventures we have had successful ventures in the past most notably the affordable greenhouse venture as well as nonsuccessful ventures every single one went through many many iterations and adaptations before they made it to their final form in essence this is the true work of the social entrepreneur iterating rethinking and returning to the drawing board to try and improve their venture in order to maintain relevance in my personal experience as part of the vision team this was especially true throughout our whole process from a technical standpoint the team had to endure the trials and tribulations of cad modeling to come up with a frame and lens model we felt was sufficient enough for our project once our lenses printed it became clear that a lot of postprocessing would have to be done in order to make our product clear the team is still in this iterative phase of the venture process to this day it was understood going in that the technology was feasible in the very near future and that our road to perfecting the technology first would be a proverbial long and winding one the team did an excellent job of adapting by keeping our options open and spending resources and time on far more accessible projects such as research and perfecting our business model of course these challenges were only exacerbated once the team arrived on the ground in arusha immediately our irb of which we needed approval for research conduction was disapproved and the team felt it was going to lose a week of important research however once again the team persevered and with the help of drs ritter and obonyo conducted factbased interviews which did not require irb approvalnbsp eventually our irb was approved and our adaptation allowed us to gracefully transition into opinionbased research with many contacts already made in the local contextnbsp as the team moved forward with the research it became clear that pessimism and anger could have dug us into a bigger hole than we had already been stuck in only through optimistic accountability and quick thinking was the team able to persevere and use adaptability to its advantage               normal                  false   false   false      enus   ja   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     style definitions  tablemsonormaltable 	msostylenametable normal 	 	 	msostylenoshowyes 	 	msostyleparent 	    	 	 	msopaginationwidoworphan 	 	fontfamilycambria 	msoasciifontfamilycambria 	msoasciithemefontminorlatin 	msohansifontfamilycambria 	msohansithemefontminorlatin     as i continue to grow as a young professional engineer and person i know this adaptability will help me improve myself through each lesson learned and mistake made while i only have a single iteration of myself my interactions with fellow human beings will be countless if each time i interact with new people or encounter new situations i can approach it with open arms and optimism adaptability will be my friend i hope it will guide me through the rest of my life and improve the wellbeing of myself and of those around me,0,0,1,0,0,psu
1898,4410,this summer i had the pleasure to work at a homeless dropincenter clinic and section  housing unit in detroit mi the experience was humbling for many reasons and made me understand the true meaning of public heatlh each day in the dropincenter and clinic i saw individuals who had calaysts on their feet were underweight did not sleep in days and were struggling from mental illness substance abuse or various chronic health conditions it was hard for me to see people lying on the streets of detroitburdened by the food insecurity and feeling lost and alone one meaningful moment however in my expereince was when i held a focus group among women who were battling homelessness in the dropincenter i heard their stories and they taught me a lot in the time i spent with them one of the most inspiring pieces of advice was from one women who was homeless for  years she told me to listen before i try to advocate for anyone be aware of who you want to help hear their stories and be the one who changes the outcomethose words were not onlyhumbling but taught be how to be leader in public health in order to be able to lead i must listen and then give back to the community that i want to serve,0,0,1,0,0,psu
1899,4373,nbsp how fast can you adapt nbsp through my hese experience one class that pushed me to the limit with adaptability was the summer half credit course  we travelled to arusha tanzania to complete field work in our respective focus of our projects for the class we as a team and as individuals had to work in a completely different environment the simplest of things were different for example meeting times our western world is driven by being on time and ending on time in tanzania things just fell into place times were set but they were not as strict of deadlines like we were use to working in we experimented in bringing our idea to their environmental context once we arrived we noticed the technology of  printing was not as matured in the region as we hoped we had to try to find opportunities where some may have seen failure to adapt in that moment meant growth we needed to understand that what we thought was right was now wrong not dwell on it and move on while there we made great use of our resources and adapted to how we would acquire the right resources for our venture the idea of networking held true but in tanzania it was more relationship driven and based off of trust many times we would talk to one person who would immediately connect us to another everyone was very friendly making it easy for the team i was on to shift focus and adapt to the ever changing environment nbsp one thing i feel we could have improved on was thinking ahead those who can adapt easily think ahead we did not anticipate receiving late confirmation of our paperwork allowing us to conduct interviews nor did we foresee how much time we would have on our hands nbspalthough i felt unprepared in that aspect of adaptability we did not whine or complain about it some days when we finished early with nothing left to do we could have scheduled in some time to have a whine session but we just pushed through accepting what ever had happened we knew every experience would make us better we never played the victim worse things have happened to teams trying to validate a new venture in a country they had never been to we saw every downfall as an opportunity to do better and be better i was fortunate enough to be placed in a team with people who went with the flow and did not allow any set back to take us of our path to ultimately providing a developing community with a resources they valued through the duration of the whole trip i had to adapt very quickly i never wanted to look as if i wasnrsquot sure what was going on more importantly i did not want to look displeased we were in someone elsersquos home and they showed an immense amount of hospitality the last thing i wanted to do was seem unappreciative of that all in all i felt this experience taught me a lot about adapting that i was not sure i possessed i want to continue to push myself out of my comfort zone i feel that is where i learn best when i cannot guess what will happen next to be an entrepreneur you must be able to adapt without this skill i think it would be hard to succeed in any environment nbsp,0,0,1,0,0,psu

1906,4413,last summer i got some great experience with the ux design process for my ist  a group of two other students and i were assigned a project in which we had to choose an existing app and change it in some way to make it better this project lasted through the entire semester as we learned about the design process we went through different stages of the process completeling piece by piece what would become our new app for the project my group and i decided to redesign the uber app uber is a kind of taxi service in which you drop your location and one of the many uber drivers come and pick you up at your location and take you to a new location with uber already having a well thought out and successful app in place i thought it would be best if we added some features on to the app that could make the overall user experience in an uber even better than it already was so with that being said we decided to add a music feature as well as a fligth connorector feature and temperature gages the music feature allows you to connect through spotify apple music and pandora and choose songs that will play thoughout your uber ride the flight feature hopefully if actually inacted would partner with airline companies would allow you to enter your flight information into the uber app which would inturn have an uber waiting for you when youlanded and finally the temperature feature was a rather simple one on the app itself you could select a temperature for the car for when it arrived to pick you up so you would not have to tell the driver to change itnbsp the most exciting part for me was user testing of our app we got to see first hand some of the problems that our design add and we were able to fix them much of these issues were rather easy to fix but it was really cool to see our add ons and creations being used first hand for the actual app design itself we chose to use invision invision made the process of implementing our prototype into an actual product very easy none of us had any experience with invision before the project but we picked it up easily finally on the last day of class we had to present to the class as if we were pitching to a real company at the end of the presentation we took questions about the app which allow us to see possible opportunitites and flaws this project is definelty what i enjoy so much about ist and its courses we were not just sitting in class listening to the professor talk instead we hands on real world experience to develop skills and teamwork nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp,1,0,0,1,0,psu

1916,4434,our strengths lie in our differences not in our similarities i learned this lesson from a young age growing up with a sibling with a disability although at first i didnt understand it this disability became the greatest blessing in our familys life the special needs community is filled with some of the most caring selfless compassionate and inspiring people you will ever find luckily i became immersed in this culture when i began volunteering at my sisters adapted soccer program topsoccer the outreach program for soccer here i saw kids push past their limits and defy the impossible kids that were told they would never walk went on to sprint down the field and score a goal the smiles on their faces were enough to leave a lasting impact on me to this day these kids do not judge each other based upon what theynbspcannotnbspdo but rather support each other for what theynbspcannbspdo this is the same outlook we should all strive towards our differences should be celebrated with respect and compassion each child had a unique situation yet came together to cheer each other on just because they must take a different path does not mean they cannot reach the same destination while these children were often facing severe challenges such as months in the hospital they still had a positive attitude and brought joy to those around them whenever i feel discouraged i think back to these kids and the obstacles they faced not once did they complain or feel selfpity instead their determination and drive led them to participate in a sport they once deemed out of their reach all the while making new friends and connections to last a lifetime as the famous quote goesnbspthe only disability in life is a bad attitude,0,0,1,0,0,psu
1917,2704,i have always believed in the power of travel to provide lifechanging experiences its not often though that i am able to combine travel with two of my favorite things backpacking and community service however penn state has given me an opportunity to experience all three of those things all while developing my leadership skills for the past two years i have led for the aurora outdoor orientation programs which are weeklong expeditions in which i get to lead incoming freshmen students through breathtaking hikes in pennsylvania backcountry and through various service projects in philadelphia the programs called orion and ursa respectively are absolutely transformative not only do they helpnbspthe students to learn about themselves but they always help me to grow in the areas of leadership and selflove i have learned so much about my personal leadership and communication styles by leading for these programs perhaps my favorite aspect about aurora though is how intouch i become to the world around me aurora opens my eyes to some of the tough issues plaguing our society today and motivates me to address them all while going on incredible adventuresnbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu
1918,4436,as a junior in high school i was offered a scholarship to swim on a division  team and i thought i had my whole college career planned out for me at the end of my junior year i was at a championship meet and i ended up tearing my shoulder pretty badly  months out of the pool and there goes my scholarship but im actually grateful for that tear oddly enoug i was picking a college based on a sport not their programs if i had gone to that school i would have been an education major and i really dont think i could have done it getting injured forced me to look at what i really wanted to do and what i enjoyed i love science and helping people i loved learning about the human body in school and had i not gotten injured i wouldnt have had a chance to put these things i love into a degree i think that injury gave me a sense that not everything is centered around me i got so absorbed into one aspect of my life that i didnt see all the other things happening around me i learned to relax and enjoy life so every time i feel myself getting caught up in my own life i have to force myself to take a step back and look at the big picturenbsp ive been working at a recreation center since i was  starting as a lifeguard i moved up throughout the summers until i became the assistant manager which was the highest i can go as a part time employee going up through the ranks i knew how it felt to be in each job that was under me and so i always tried to help out my guards and my instructors because i know their job is already hard enough this taught me that no matter how high you go you need to remember where you came from and how it feels for the people doing those jobs ive learned that every moment is a teaching moment because new guards look to me on how to respond i became a lifeguard instructor because i wanted to teach people how to save lives and i wanted to be a good instructor because i didnt have one ive used my lgi certification to teach cpr classes at high schools in my area as well as updating the teachers certifications as well i have been able to pass on all the tips and tricks that i have learned and i hope that they will do the same i think this also gave me an interest in the healthcare field because i wanted to save lives different aspects and experiences in my life have taught me lessons that no book could ever teach and im grateful for every moment even the bad ones each day is a chance to learn something new and i believe that you can do just that theres always going to be someone who knows more than you and if you want to get better you have to be willing to listennbsp,0,0,1,0,1,psu
1919,4437,my story has to start with my family because they are the ones who have shaped me into who i am my mom is so selfless and compassionate my dad is hardworking and strong and my brother and sister are adopted and have inspiring resilience my parents have always pushed me to work hard and to get good grades and get involved in my community so thats exactly what i did i volunteered through my church i was involved in concert choir show choir musicals and an ambassador program all while maintaining good grades my junior year of high school though i hit a bit of a speed bump when i became severely bullied leading to depression and anxiety my grades dropped and i lost almost all of my friends but luckily my parents had taught me how to be strong i eventually overcame the events of my junior year leading me to become president of my show choir and eventually be accepted into my dream school penn state although what i went through was lifealtering and somewhat damaging i am so grateful for what i experienced because it lead me to the major i am in today i am so incredibly passionate about helping children and teenagers who were in my position and not letting anyone go through what i did alone i now feel that it is my calling in life to aid in the improvement of the cyber bullying epidemic in this country and i will do everything in my power to achieve my goals and make sure that no one suffers this past summer i had the opportunity of travelling to san jose de copan honduras where i worked with children and taught them about good health and hygeine this is another event that has molded and shaped me into the successful studentnbspi have become and i am so grateful for the journey i have taken to achievenbspthis successnbsp,0,0,1,0,1,psu
1920,4418,one of my most memorable experiences occurred during the summer before my sophomore year of high school i was invited and decided to go on a travel program for students with people to people for  days spanning five countries in europe as a fifteenyearold this decision was out of the ordinary for me as i was the child who usually took more time to adapt to new environments and situations and was slightly more reserved than others however this opportunity was one that i could not decline travel was one of my passions and i was excited to experience another culture   while in europe i participated in a multitude of eyeopening experiences i gave back to a community by assisting them with a local project i visited mauthausen concentration camp in austria where i understood the importance of history and empathy i had a threeday homestay in munich germany where i followed my friend to school every day and met her classmates  my experience in europe taught me some of the most important lessons that remain with me today it taught me the significance of understanding other cultures and acceptance while my homestay friend was widely different from me in terms of her culture food preferences and habits we found many similarities between us such as our music preferences this showed me that other cultures are not as different from our own as we may think diversity exists yet there is always common ground to discover it also taught me the importance of challenging myself to take new experiences when they are available accumulating knowledge starts with novel experiences if i had not pushed myself to go on this journey i would not have learned what i did or understood that being uncomfortable is necessary for ones growth although this experience occurred more than five years ago it was a defining moment for me as an individual not only did my love for travel blossom because of this trip but i also gathered a lot of insight about myself and other cultures,0,0,1,0,0,psu

1925,4427,throughout high school i had the privilege of playing volleyball and basketball from the time i was a freshman until i graduated as a senior when i was  years old however i experienced a life changing injury that would put my sports career in jeopardy forever one day at volleyball practice i landed on my feet after jumping to block a hit from across the net when i landed i felt my lower back give out and had a rush of extreme pain the pain subsided just moments later but i knew something had gone horribly wrong after months of endless xrays mris and doctors visits i was diagnosed with a herniated disc luckily my doctor was a family friend and therefore knew how passionate i was about sports he took the time to explain to me what the risksbenefits were that i would face if i continued to play sports with this type of injury i could either miss out on endless memories with my friends and teammates or suffer through the pain that accompanied a herniated disc  to the surprise of many i decided i was going to tough it out and do what i loved during my senior year my volleyball team won the wpial and piaa state championship and i had the honor of representing my teammates as a captain the injury took a major toll on me mentally and physically but i learned a lot about myself throughout the journey i proved to myself that i could do anything i put my mind to and witnessed firsthand just how important communication and patience are when working with a team the pain i experienced varied daytoday so it was essential that i exercised communication and verbalized to my coaches and teammates exactly how i was feeling during each gamepractice although i always wanted to participate and be involved i learned that i needed to put the teams needs before my own this meant i had to be entirely honest about what my limitations were and it taught me that it is okay to lean on others once in awhile most importantly i learned that there is good in every bad situation all you have to do is find it i wish i could undo this permanent and lifelong injury but i am eternally grateful for the lessons it has taught me i firmly believe that i will reflect on these qualities often in my future career as a health care provider                 normal                  false   false   false      enus   ja   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     style definitions  tablemsonormaltable 	msostylenametable normal 	 	 	msostylenoshowyes 	 	msostyleparent 	    	 	 	msopaginationwidoworphan 	 	fontfamilycambria 	msoasciifontfamilycambria 	msoasciithemefontminorlatin 	msohansifontfamilycambria 	msohansithemefontminorlatin   ,0,0,0,1,1,psu

1933,4447,the foremost quality a leader needs to possess is altruism ever since middle school i have been developing my passion for service to others some of the service projects i have been involved in include wreaths across america my communityrsquos nursing home volunteer program and my middle schoolrsquos and high schoolrsquos minithon it just so happened that in service to others i found who i really wanted to be through my involvement in wreaths across america and my schoolrsquos minithon i started to grow a passion for helping both military men and women and the medical field i found that those who lead are often in constant service to others  nbsp another quality i believe that leaders need to possess is resilience i believe that resilience develops the heart one of the leaders in my life my dad has gone through many challenges in his life he faced cancer in his early  and back when he was getting treatment chemotherapy was harsh and the only treatment available he recently told me that he was not expected to live past the  year mark he has been cured for about  years now but there are often times when people question how happy he can be day in and day out he says that his trick is to get up everyday and to start his day with a smile because you never know what life is going to throw at you and happiness and a smile is your best armornbsp nbsp the ability to communicate is of the utmost importance when being a leader communication through speaking effectively is essential to effective leadership because in order to communicate how much you care you must know how to articulate those words if a person is an effective speaker they can convey what they want across to an audience in the way they intended being a leader means to dig deep into yourself and often wear your heart on your sleeve each and everyday i wear my heart on my sleeve which allows me to grow as individual and strengthen my relationship with others overall what makes a leader is their passion to be there for others having strength and the ability to selfevaluate to continually improve nbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
1934,4448,during the november session of the womens leadership initiative a panel of female leaders from various careers spoke about how risktaking has imacted their leadership this panel discussion was quite insightful as to the importance of risktaking in order to truly reach ones leadership potential in decision making i focus primarily on the potential consequences of my choices often though i tend to magnify the likelihood of negative outcomes and minimize the potential of positive ones all of the women in the panel spoke about leadership as a pathway to new experiences and learning opportunities they said that even if the outcome of a risk is not what we had hoped it does not mean the outcome is negative there is always growth learning and new ideas for future success that come with failure this panel gave me a clearer picture of the type of risktaker i hope to become in the future i will be willing to take risks that can benefit the majority of my organization or that align with my core values i plan to take the risk to speak up when i find injustice in the workplace even when my job may be questioned because of it i now believe that a career without risktaking is lukewarm and stagnant it is not passionate about new advancements or willing to test out new ideas and it certainly is content with complacency while taking risks needs to be done cautiously it is a major method toward progress both professionally and personally,1,0,0,0,0,psu

1976,4409,the most intriguing system of design i have ever come across is from a book called steal like an artist this book was meant for an artist looking to create new pieces of work but the methodology in this book can be applied to everyday life every object in existence was created after multiple encounters with other objects and redesigned in a better way after the fact whether we realize it or not we are always subconsciouslynbspcopying and pasting then modifying this process eventually leads to a new item to be created and is how everything is madeafter reading this book i began to study other applications and their functions for example what service is provided to a user and why would they want it and how was this implemented from a developers viewpoint this may lead to building the same application but by implementing functions my own way and addingremoving functions it will lead to a creation i can call my own one of my applications ive made recently is called waldoa employeremployee finding application was modeled after a more popular application called uber though the contents are different and there are few similarities the main idea stemmed from uber and changed entirely due to modifications thus making the application mine its okay to steal theft is aok,1,1,1,0,0,psu
1977,4409,though philadelphia is one of the most historical locations in the united states it has been superseded by more developed cities recently due to gentrification many locations in the united states are currently taking the initiative to go green on a larger scale due to collective action but philadelphia hasnt for a variety of factors one of these factors is that the city does not have too much money and that the money is being spent elsewhere in the city there are barely any public trashcans the streets remain damaged and education professionals are paid frugally due to this volunteering is necessary for the city to remain clean in high school i spent most of my weekends cleaning up the city along with a volunteer group together we moved in a pack and cleaned up street by street using gloves bags and an occasional broom for the cigarette buds while volunteering i was able to understand how important it is to keep the streets clean and why each of us needs to take up responsibility recycling is important and can keep prices low but trash cant be recycled unless its collected and not rotting on a street concurrently trash rotting on the street doesnt really appeal to tourist and thus there will be less tourist ergo less money for the city thats why its important that each of us do our part whenever possiblethe streets belong to us,0,0,0,1,0,psu

1987,4379,creative thinking is an approach to thinking that includes presenting unorthodox solutions this process can take the form through either a structured or unstructured process but at its core it is about the quality of new ideas through my experiences as a hese student i have worked to present solutions to complex problems that require a new approach if these grand challenges had already been solved there would be no need for an innovative solution or the hese program at all  nbsp specifically i have been on teams that have focused on two development challenges water scarcity and food security while working on the both projects we always began by researching what has already been done to address these problems but more than just what has been done examining why those approached failed by determining the failure modes for much of the previous work we were able to understand where these traditional thinking methods came from and why they didnrsquot work therefore if we wanted to be successful we had no other options that to look at the problems with a new perspective an example of when i used these techniques is when i was completing research for the water scarcity project it began by analyzing whether the people in mozambique had any access to water and the answer was yes there were a plethora of wells rivers lakes and ravines for people to attain water from the problem lied with the salt water intrusion it appeared that the salt water from the ocean was seeping through the ground across the country and into the wells and other bodies of water from there i examined the different desalination projects that had already occurred in mozambique and why they failed i learned that most of the previous work had been investments in large scale desalination facilities most of the facilities themselves were not failures but were just inappropriately sized for rural populations due to the upfront capital cost it was from these sources i was able to develop a more holistic understanding of why desalination has not become widely used throughout mozambique nbsp this new perspective included a deep dive into the pains of the end user we tried to understand exactly what their lives were like and how these problems affected them through an empathetic understanding of our end user we were able to use more nuanced design approaches such as usercentered design more than just suggesting a solution we decided to test the assumptions by testing our assumptions we were able to learn more about the problem and how to adjust our projects to better fit the need one example of where we used these principles includes when we travelled to arusha tanzania and tried to build our product ourselves our product was a  walled structure we had made an assumption that you could use all of the materials from your land with a few small purchases and build the structure yourself as we soon learned the materials we expected to be available were not and the new materials required experienced masons for construction  nbsp                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      wlsdexception lockedfalse  namegrid table  dark,1,0,1,0,0,psu
1988,4379,upon my teamrsquos arrival in arusha we had a construction timeline and plan detailed for the entire threeweek research trip we mapped out days for assimilation building and interviews to maximize our time on the ground our assimilation days turned out to be construction days for a different project due to some communication errors in addition to three days of inappropriate work we had our culture immersion trip and day of rest which we had accounted for we were not even a week in and our entire timeline had been destroyed instead of complaining about the situation and trying to push through a plan that was no longer feasible we decided to adapt we spent a new day working with our partners to reorient the team and establish new goals this allowed us to have clear expectations of what our partners wanted from us and what our intentions for the remainder of the trip were we spent the next day establishing a new timeline to make the most of the remainder of the trip nbsp concurrently we were informed that the design of our structure was not appropriate for the region we were working in we were planning on using a rammed earth process and mold to create the walls of our structure but this technique is not common in arusha tanzania therefore the workers we intended to hire to build the structure would be missing the training required to implement this program as an alternative we found that using hydraform bricks to build structures is something that they know the hydraform bricks do not have a continuous seal along the walls that we were looking for to reduce the amount of air passageways but they were made of earthen materials our project focused on using earthen materials to reduce heat transfer so we felt that it was important to keep the use of soil at the forefront of our design  nbsp all of the adaptations we implemented came with tradeoffs for example our construction timeline got shortened which prevented us from immediately collecting data on our structure but with some of the excess time we had waiting for our materials to arrive we used speak with local businesses and ngos about our project and potential to become a venture                   normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          wlsdex,0,0,1,0,1,psu

1990,4409,during my freshman year at psu i happened to choose the most enlightening courses simultaneously and it allowed me to broaden my mindset these two classes were mysticism and jewish studies while these two school of thoughts arent on completely different ends of the spectrum they are certainly far apart in judaism we took a look into the mishnehnbsptorah and slowly took into account what the philosopher maimonides had to say i think that religion is certainly important and we can learn many things from it however that is support and not my religious views the key attributes i identified in judaism were leniency and fairness mysticism also included various attributes such as fairness but this fairness was not attached to leniency in addition to this mysticism had certain traits that leaned towards idolatry which goes against judaism there is a lot to learn from religion so religion is in fact necessary as it builds character through the transference of knowledge,0,0,0,0,0,psu

1997,4850,my father constantly flys to the ukraine on business and i occasionally join him we have a restaurant supply company in the capital city kiev although the operation runs fairly smoothly without our participation there are certain issues that require supervision my role in this organization is to help the employees at promaster with their english language preparing them for meetings with united states clients when we arrive to the ukraine we set up various meetings based on time availability my meetings are more laid back and easy going so that the employees feel comfortable using their second language the reason for the low pressure meeting is to give the ukrianian employees ability to really practive the english language overtime i have found that asking random common english questions such as how is the weather or what do you think about the news last night allows for the best feedback from the employees of course at first people tend to be nervous because some arent too familiar with the language however over the course of the meeting they seem to lighten up and become fairly efficient at answering the question my efforts in warming up the teamss seem to pay off when they virtually meet with the clients in fact i follow up with some of the clients and they confirm that the staff has improvednbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu
1998,4401,a few weeks into my internship with surge business development and i find myself feeling comfortable and confident in my ability to interact and assist my employer and my peer interns with projects when i first started i was adjusting each day at a time because i did not know what to expect and this was my first time actually putting all my developed skills to the test i am a very organized goaloriented and creative person with technical skills such as troubleshooting basic computer issues coding with java and c operating in a professional while fastpace environment etc i have confidence in my skills but it still was a little scary not knowing what would be required of me i have interned for about four weeks now and i have gained a lot of comfortability and confidence from being a part of project teams as well as being a project lead in order to become comfortable and confident i believe it is crucial to get your feet wet meaning that a person should get the necessary experience with their pursued field of work i have so far been well off with my experiences some slightly nerveracking and others fun i like building confidence and improving my skills so i take everything good and bad with my experiences with this internship i will have a lot of stories to talk about,0,0,1,1,0,psu
1999,4374,think of a time during your hese journey limited to     classes when you exhibited strengths with respect to working towards ensuring that your team worked in a synergistic manner what worked well how can your continuously grow and develop yourself nbsp a time when my team worked in a synergistic manner was during the  class this happened when we were preparing for the final presentation of the class in that presentation we had to present a semester worth of work and we had to learn from previous mistakes to deliver an excellent presentation  nbsp throughout the semester we struggled with assignments and other presentations we always received feedback that let us know that we could do better for instance when we presented our technology which was a mushroom grow facility we completely failed at delivering the message the presentation did not tell a coherent and believable story and was not wellpieced together we had a hard time getting the audience to understand and appreciate the importance of the technology we were presenting in addition we contradicted ourselves when we were answering questions from the audience we had a long way to go and the journey was not easy a lot of our struggle came from the fact that many team members werenrsquot as committed to the work needed in the class as others their priorities were set differently so it was hard to deliver outstanding presentations everyone in the team had a different idea of what was needed in the presentations some people had stronger opinions and egos than others we were not working as a unit most of the time and this reflected on our work and presentations  nbsp however a change occurred during the weeks leading to our final presentation team members started to get involved and show up to meetings this had a positive impact on the quality of our final presentation i remember that for preparing for that final presentation we all decided to get inspired and motivated to do well we wanted to show that we had learned something from all of the feedback we had received throughout the semester for example one area where i decided to contribute was with the cad drawings i decided to learn how to use sketchup to present our final prototype other teams used it in previous presentations and received positive feedback from the instructor and judges this made me realize that i had to change my approach for the benefit of the team namely by using a software that people were familiar with  nbsp to start we divided the work that needed to be done among ourselves afterwards we started working individually to finish the assigned parts that were given we picked several days during the week before the presentation to meet and discuss potential changes these sessions were very dynamic as everyone actively participated the involvement of every team member allowed us to work more efficiently we finished some of the contents of the presentation in a matter of an hour that was new to us we were able to work well together because we were in synergy we were listening to each other and giving constructive suggestions to improve the quality of the presentation it was so interesting to be present at that moment and be aware of that change of mentality in the team it was great to see that as soon as we resolved our team discrepancies everything started to change for the better for instance resolving our ineffective communication poor management and poor leadership allowed us to move in the right direction  nbsp the way our team functioned throughout the semester was an ideal example of how poor team synergy can impact the work delivered it is important to recognize early on in the process that we all have our individual differences we all have different priorities talents weaknesses interests and habits these factors have a large influence on the coordination of a team if we cannot align these sentiments early on in the process progress is hindered this was the case for our team we had low productivity because we were not coordinated there was a lack of responsibility and accountability it took us time to realize that a lot of these factors were keeping us away from success  nbsp however when we started sharing the same vision values and goals we realized that we could move mountains we were able to create an effective final presentation because we reestablished trust respect and compassion in the team it was not an easy road but we navigated it as a team and we learned from our mistakes dedicating time to each complete our work and understand our responsibilities allowed us to do better we received great feedback for our presentation and a lot of the comments we received was about how we came together as a team to deliver excellent work nbsp nbsp nbsp,0,0,0,1,0,psu

2015,4374, think of a time during your hese journey limited to     classes when you exhibited strengths with respect to leadership what worked well how can you continuously grow and develop yourself nbsp nbsp nbsp leadership is the act of guiding a group of people or an organization when i think of leaders i think of people with extraordinary qualities who have positively impacted the world i struggled with the idea and definition of leadership at first because i had a hard time associating it with myself this made it difficult to remember an instance in my hese journey where i had exhibited leadership skills the broad definition and picture i had in my mind did not help me see the kind of leader i had been in hese  nbsp to help me understand my leadership style i decided to take a leadership test online the results of the test indicated that i was a diplomatic leader diplomatic leaders prize interpersonal harmony they look toward what the future can bring ldquodiplomats are genuinely wise about working with other people diplomats know that the person they are working with is as real as they are and so they have an extraordinary capacity for respect they are caring and patient and always purposeful they are the social glue and affiliative force that keeps groups togetherrdquo though i was surprised with the result of the online test i recognized some truth in itnbsp i listen compromise and reach a consensus recognizing my leadership style allowed me to identify moments in hese where some of those qualities prevailed  nbsp in  i remember times when i had to be patient with my team members the mushroom team often struggled to accomplish anything towards the end of the semester our failures empowered me to do better and help the team do better i suggested that we meet more often to complete the final presentation and try to work with everybodyrsquos schedule i had to lead by example and as such i decided to complete some of the slides earlier and show an animated cad model of the mushroom house to the team  nbsp in  i remember that the team could not agree on the model of the cold room to deploy to tanzania the size shape and materials of the cold room divided us some designs included a double pitch roof a dome shape clay tiles evaporative cooling and all sorts of complicated designs that could not being implemented in our  weeks on the ground after listening to what everybody had to say i suggested that the team opt for a single pitch roof i also  modeled the structure and started to run simulations to validate the design  nbsp there were instances in  where strong disagreements were present in the cold room team one of the areas we disagreed a lot on was with the timeline of the project i often had to take a few steps back to collect myself and think of ways to bring the team back together it wasnrsquot always easy but team cohesion was more important than personal gain for example if one person wanted to dedicate  days for construction while another one wanted to build for  days i would propose  days i remember specifically that the last two days of the trip we had a hard time reaching a consensus on whether or not we should spend the remaining days at the construction site or interviewing relevant stakeholders agreeing was an issue this is when i proposed that we spend one day talking to local organizations and the last day at the construction site to assess the progress of the cold room i weighted the pros and cons of each activity i also remembered that a few scholars we had interviewed mentioned the names of organizations in arusha that were doing work in postharvest loss and were worth talking to nbsp nbsp to help the team move forward i took the initiative to find the contact information of a local organization doing research on postharvest loss the world vegetable center i sent them an email to find out if the cold room team could stop by and have a chat with them after two hours i suggested that we call one of their postharvest specialists we were able to reach them and set up an appointment on the same day the people at the world vegetable center were friendly and welcoming they gave us a tour of their facility and gave us a lot of insights on postharvest loss the information we gained by visiting the world vegetable center was extremely valuable  nbsp these examples made me realize that the idea of leadership i had in mind was incorrect leaders come in all forms some leaders are pragmatic while others are idealist every style has its merit depending on the circumstances leadership is not static it changes and evolves depending on the situation and the people in the team i believe that in the context of hese i have mostly been a diplomatic leader  nbsp nbsp nbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2024,4374, after reflecting onnbspmarks session in ournbspclass i am confident that you can come up with very good principles for doing community engagement in a meaningful and winwin way i am therefore not assigning any reading i want you to reflect on the different communities you have immersed yourself in as part of your journey in the hese program nbsp what did you do really well can you identify areas of improvement think dust on the lens of the cameras flip the view inwards how can you grow and develop to the next level of optimal performance with respect to community engagement nbsp during the hese program i immersed myself in developing communities and learned a lot from them nbsp according to the center for disease control community engagement can be defined as a strategic process with a specific purpose to work with identified groups of people connected by geographic location special interest or affiliation in order to address issues that affect their wellbeing community engagement is about the collective it is also about diversity including diversity of people diversity of thoughts diversity of opinions etc community engagement is about engaging with a community to achieve long term and sustainable outcomes relationships and decisionmaking  nbsp there are various instances in  where i engaged and immersed myself in the community our trip to tanzania gave us an amazing opportunity to work with people in different communities for instance one way to engage with the community was to discuss with people at the nelson mandela institute we had the opportunity to engage with faculty and scholars from the university and use their knowledge to move forward with our projects the cold room team interacted with professors that were experts in postharvest loss having an informal discussion with them was truly beneficial and it allowed us to identify local organizations working on issues of postharvest loss one such organization was the world vegetable center that welcomed us in their facilities and gave us the opportunity to engage with them researchers at the center showed us a few projects they had been working on and the types of storage techniques they had come across with we talked about the cold room and they seemed interested in hearing more about it  nbsp another example of engaging with the community was with respect to building the cold room the community at the star primary school kindly collaborated with us and gave us new insights into their way of life the first day we visited star primary we were welcomed by teachers and school children the students had prepared a song and dance for us when we arrived we were happy to be invited at the school and share a meal with the community for the remainder of the trip we talked to many actors such as masons farmers teachers and other people in the community putting some effort in understanding the cultural context around us allowed us to bridge a gap with the community from the get go we showed that we were willing to learn from the community and in turn they were willing to participate in the process drawing on local knowledge allowed us to engage with the people some people in the community taught us a few words in swahili listening to people from different backgrounds empowered us to think of a solution that would be appropriate for the community one of the most important of aspect of engaging with the community was creating local networks of people and increasing our social capital  nbsp other occasions when we engaged with the community were during trips to the surrounding areas of arusha for instance whenever we travelled to downtown arusha we engaged with the local community going to the grocery store was a fun adventure we took taxis and talked with taxi drivers that had a lot of interesting information we went to local souvenir shops where we had to bargain with sellers the souvenir shop was a new experience as sellers all fought to have customers come to their stores traveling in arusha gave us new perspectives on the community and their lifestyle  nbsp there are a few lessons that i have learned from community engagement it is important to recognize that the opinions of everyone matters what the community shares is as important as what one shares with them community engagement is a twoway information sharing tool knowledge doesnrsquot need to come exclusively from academia indigenous knowledge is also essential community engagement is significant when an aggregate of perspectives is acknowledged community engagement cannot be onesided strong opinions can hinder the decisionmaking process there is a lot of listening that needs to happen for effective engagement  nbsp nbsp nbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2031,4374, drawing from your experiences in hese write a blog that contextualizes the issues raised in the transcript provided below discuss these issues from the perspective of a venture deployment within an emerging economy are there some common ethical issues that can be attributed to rule breaking habits of the founding ceo identify the unique additional layers of complexities for a venture that is designed for deployment in an emerging economy propose some strategies for ensuring that the rule breaking founding ceo who wants to run your current venture is kept in check with respect to ethical judgement nbsp nbsp nbsp the transcript provided gives an overview of dilemmas present in the startup industry many of these startups used to be held at higher ethical standards and a lot of people did not believe that serious breaches in ethics could occur in such environment however recent scandals have proven that startups are not immune to these ethical issues a lot of ethical problems found when deploying a venture can be found in many startups  nbsp nbsp nbsp ethical problems encountered in startups include lack of infrastructure lack of trust from investors strong desire to achieve and cultural impact startups often do not have the internal framework necessary to manage ethical issues and enforce ethical compliance many startups entrepreneurs are too overwhelmed to monitor the behavior of their employees because they focus their energy on making profits marketing and creating a corporate culture the transcript clearly describes how the leaders of startups often lack soft skills they pay little attention to the hiring process which results in less emphasis on human capital several startups do not treat their employees with respect and promote a culture where interpersonal relationships are forgotten they set unrealistic expectations and offer compensation that is not equivalent to the employeesrsquo efforts lack of emotional intelligence paired with poor management is a recipe for disaster  nbsp nbsp nbsp in terms of trust with regards to investors many startups make poor ethical decisions in order to receive funding some startups have been found to fudge the numbers they present to their potential investors and customers in order to appeal to them even when they receive funding the pressures to meet the expectations of the vc investors can lead to fraudulent activities and misrepresentation a desire to achieve a goal at all cost could also be accounted for poor ethical judgement there is nothing wrong with passion and commitment to an idea and a ldquofail fastrdquo attitude however trying to find shortcuts to achieve fast results is counterproductive startups can fall into traps when commercializing new products and services these traps should be avoided as startups have the power to shape communities  nbsp nbsp nbsp ethical dilemmas exist in every profession and industry however social entrepreneurs often face dilemmas that are more difficult to manage deploying a venture in emerging markets requires strong moral compass and social entrepreneurs can fall short of the ethical expectations the issues faced by startups ceo are often the same for social entrepreneurs in emerging economies i have identified a few pillars that enterprises engaging in developing markets should keep in mind in order to remain ethical  nbsp nbsp nbsp deploying a venture in developing communities requires fairness it is important to pursue a business model that is a winwin for all stakeholders involved success should be measured by how happy the community and entrepreneur are the outcome of the venture should be positive for everyone it is unacceptable to believe that success can be obtained at the expense of the community social entrepreneurs should understand the context in which they launch their ventures and should let the community welcome them and accept them in their daily lives the relationship should be mutual the community should not feel pressured to accept an idea in the context of the cold room it was important to share our knowledge with the rural community and build the cold room but it was also important to understand the needs of the rural community and integrate their ideas into our design  nbsp nbsp nbsp deploying a venture in emerging markets requires integrity being ethical requires having a great sense of integrity it is important to communicate the truth about the product being promoted false statements and promises can disengage the community and give an entrepreneur a negative reputation in many emerging communities the words a person say have a lot more weight than a contract the value proposition of the venture should be clear to the community it is essential to not mislead people and present the facts being straightforward and honest is the key it is also important to remain transparent with investors it is unethical to use funds for a purpose they were not intended for in the context of the cold room the team tried to build with what we had and put an emphasis on building relations with the community nbsp nbsp nbsp deploying a venture in emerging markets requires decency paying attention to local sensitivities and cultural norms in a country is very important launching a product without understanding the cultural context of the area can cause anger and offense to the people the idea must be appropriate with the cold room we made sure that we asked for permission before building anything and we used materials the community was comfortable with nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp deploying a venture in emerging markets requires sustainability resources must be used efficiently social entrepreneurs should pay attention to how they use local resources and how the community can afford to pay for these resources the business model of the venture must make sense with respect to what is available the venture itself must be sustainable once the venture is set up it is important that local communities are capable of using the products for their own benefits without requiring the constant help of the entrepreneurs this is the reason why establishing strong local partnerships is important local organizations have the capacity to help and engage with the community while in arusha we talked to organizations and scholars that had a direct connection with local farmers nbsp nbsp nbsp deploying a venture in emerging markets requires a strong code of conduct and compliance program ventures should comply with local laws from safety regulations fiscal law environmental law to civil rights it is important to obtain peoplersquos consent when conducting research local communities should have a clear picture of what the venture is about they should not be treated as subjects but as people local communities should also be referenced the information they provide is valuable and it is crucial to acknowledge it local communities should be wellpresented and not stereotyped any forms of representation should reflect the intelligence resilience and capabilities of the community a strong code of conduct is important because it promotes trust reduces conflicts of interests and reinforces important values whenever we had informal discussion with scholars farmers or organizations we made sure to clearly explain the purpose of our work and ask for

2035,4449,during my time as a wli student at penn state i was given the opportunity to attend a panel discussion about risktaking and how it relates to leadership i learned so much from this panel i never saw myself as much of a risktaker  actually i saw myself as quite the opposite i am someone who enjoys feeling comfortable in life and often lets my fear of failure keep me from taking risks howevernbspi learned from the discussion that taking risks is both essential and critical to be successful and advance as a leader also it was discussed that taking risks is always a learning experience and even if simply learning a lesson is the only reward you get from taking that risk  its a success another important takeaway from the panel was that taking risks isnrsquot all that scary as long as you believe in yourself and are confident in your decisions risktaking comes naturally nbsp nbspdue to all of these things i heard from the panel discussion i can definitely see myself taking healthy risks as a leader in the future as long as i analyze the situation and am confident in my decision or the risk i am taking i know everything will work out one of the panelists said ldquoleap and the net will appearrdquo so for me i will take that leap or risk in life as a leader and i know that something will be there to catch me and things will work out how they are meant to be irsquove realized that my fear of failure is not a justifiable reason for not taking a risk i know i must carefully weigh the outcomes when taking a risk and consider if other people will be affected by my decision ndash because as a leader this is often the case ndash and then make the best possible decision after analyzing the situation i believe this is what healthy risktaking is and it is something i will definitely do as i progress as a leader nbsp                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                wlsdexcep,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2037,4401,good morning to all my readers it is november   and i am back at school from thanksgiving break i had a pretty good break and i really enjoyed the holiday with my family though i complain about always being busy and not having free time while im at school during my break i had a lot of free time and i did not use it to relax or indulge in leisure necessarily i used my free time to work on homework that would be due at the end of the week returning from the break some may say im an overachiever and i would agree and add that i just like to keep busy and be productive as possible  nbsp if you think about it it made sense to do work during the break because i had free time so i figured irsquod get ahead so once i got back to school i would not have to rush and cram work as others may do since lightening up my workload i now have more time so i can go to the gym work on music hang out with friends and even play my  i am the type of person who really likes no loves to keep busy hence why my entry is titled idle when i die because i will not sit still until the day that i die in relation i did not only work on homework but i also worked on my music productions and write down some things that i plan on implementing for the application i want to make,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2038,4434,this past semester i have really come to understand the value of networking prior to this year i thought networking was only for highly successful experienced and extroverted professionals however i now realize that networking is for everyonenbsp as an introvert i often struggle to come out of my shell and meet new people especially professionally these interactions can be quite intimidating especially developing that initial connection after attending the networking session at the womens leadership initiative at penn state i walked away inspired and determined to expand my networking capabilities networking is a form of risktaking but one that usuallynbsppays off in dividends even if you dont think youll ever cross paths with someone or have anything in common there is nothing to lose by introducing yourself and having a brief conversation since then i have reached out to professionals through personal connections like friends and family faculty at recruiting events and online furthermore i practiced networking at the fall career fair where i gavenbspmy elevator speech and inquired about internship opportunities lastly i have revamped my linkedin profile and reached out to colleagues for connections since i am looking for an internship for this upcoming summer these networks are extremely valuable in giving me a legup on the competition in the application process however networking goes both ways i try to be of as much value to the other person as they are to me and serve as a mentor to underclassmen by introducing them to others who may be of assistance i offer my connections and background to them as well therefore networking is not just about trying to land a job but rather forming lasting and meaningful relationships i plan on continuing these networking practices throughout my entire lifetime as relationships are the most important thing in life and can take you places you may have never imagined possible lately ive been surprised at how true the old saying its a small world after all is i have run into people from years ago or found a mutual acquaintance so easily that it really solidified the power of a simple connection no matter how brief,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2039,4435,the first weekend of the semester we participated in a team building retreat where we learned to work together and to step outside of our comfort zones all morning we did small group challenges to get to know each other and our leadership styles but everything we learned was really put to the test in the afternoon the second half of the day was spend in helmets and harnesses  feet above the ground on a ropes course i learned a few things about my self during this challenge other than that i am very afraid of heights i learned to put my trust in girls that i had just met a few hours before to trust my own abilities and to just go for it sometimes all three of these things are things that i struggle with in general i tend to be a little hesitant and to overthink situations so this really put that to the test then last week at class we learned a lot more about ourselves through a values assessment we narrowed down a list of core values to our top two which was way harder than i thought it was going to be i finally settled on family and honesty as my top two values which did not really surprise me my family is really tight knit and they are usually my top priority and i think that honesty is the most important value in any relationship although my top two values were not a surprise i did learn a few things from this activity my biggest take away was that everybody had different core values and when in a leadership position it is important to consider the fact that everyone might not value the same things you do and that you have to be respectful of that i think keeping this in mind will make me a more conscientious and fair leader,0,0,1,0,1,psu

2043,4416,one topic that really stood out to me this semester was risk taking from the first time my classmates and i met at stone valley risk taking was embedded in our brains at our last session one of our panelists jessica dolan said leap when the net appears this quote stood out to me because it made me curious and less fearful you have no idea what is going to be at the bottom of that net when you jump but if you dont jump how are you ever going to find out without taking a risk you will never know what the outcome may be through this session i learned that it is ok to take that leap even if there are snakes at the bottom of the net even if the outcome is not so great you can always climb back up despite criticism from jessicas family she took the risk of opening her own business after hard work and determination she is a successful business owner working on bigger and better projects every day when i look back at my college career thus far i have taken risks maybe not as big as starting my own business but i have taken risks without even knowing it risk taking is all around us jessica along with our other panelists are a prime example of what taking a chance can do a leader needs to be willing to take risks find solutions believe in themselves and have reflecting time in the future i do envision myself taking healthy risks here at penn state i take risks by supporting my personal beliefs and standing up for things that i love regardless of what people may say or think i take risks by not letting peoplesnbspopinions define me or bring me down i voice my opinion and allow people to judge me on my character and actions rather than social religious or political beliefsnbsp for my career i dream of attending a ranked graduate school and working in a hospital setting with individuals who have injuries or seizures that impair their speaking ability recently i have been debating this dream in fear of not getting into a graduate school or not being smart enough to excel in a hospital setting surrounded by doctors and nurses i have researched dream schools but i have also researched schools i know i will get into after the risk taking session i am confident that my role as an slp in a hospital is crucial to a patients recovery even if i am not as smart as the surgeon beside me i have knowledge about communication skills that he may not therefore my dream job is still in range and i am willing to take the risk of being placed in an intimidating situation in order to help someone in need as for graduate school i am taking the risk and applying to all big name schools that are ranked within the top twenty for my program i am leaping into the net all at once if i am given the opportunity to get myself out there why would i not take it if i do not apply to the school of my dreams how will i know if i would have gotten in taking risks has taught me not to be afraid and to be confident in myself as a leader i plan to take this knowledge with me and remember to always leap into the net and never be afraid of the snakes that may be at the bottom,0,1,0,0,0,psu
2044,4401,just a day ago i was adjusting to all my new classes remembering the locations and times for each and now the semester is two weeks from over some days and weeks do go by slow for me but once i get close and or make it to the end of a trial eg years of school etc it feels like the time flew by in essence i was not really counting the days until this semester would end because despite all the frustrating and extensive work that had to be done i enjoy my time at school as i am living on my own away from home i am around good friends and the school is a fun environment to be around each academic year i dread christmas break because for me its too long as i just stated above i like being away from home and having my personal space so i donrsquot really crave long breaks from school or desire to stay home for more than a week at best all and all this semester has gone by relatively fast and honestly i cannot wait for the spring semester to start i donrsquot forward to the work at all but you know the freedom fun and friends fff thethreefs,0,0,1,0,0,psu

2052,4418,over the course of one semester with womenrsquos leadership initiative i have learned so much that i will take with me as a future leader one topic that particularly impacted me was our panel discussion on risktaking the panelists who attended were so insightful about risktaking with regards to leadership their passion and attitudes toward risktaking caused me to reflect on what risktaking truly was they explained risktaking as an attitude that you choose to have this resonated with me because this reflects risktaking not as a personality trait that some may be more inclined to having but a choice that anyone can make anyone in any circumstance can choose to take risks this idea really gave me the confidence and strength to be more open to taking future risks the panelists also discussed that risktaking is about not knowing how events will turn out it is important that you take risks and it is acceptable to make mistakes this changed my opinion about risktaking instead of seeing it as an aspect that some individuals may have perfected risktaking is an attitude that everyone is still attempting to master one of the panelists summed up the importance of being confident and open to taking risks that i hope to never forget she said ldquoleap and the net appearsrdquo nbsp i plan to apply the knowledge and insight i learned from this risktaking panel in my future career as a leader by changing my perceptions of risktaking i now strongly believe in risktaking as an attitude and will challenge myself to continue to take risks despite how intimidating they may be as a future leader who believes in progress and innovation risktaking plays an integral role i will carry the wisdom that these panelists provided me with as i continue to develop as a future leader i am building and plan to continue building my confidence with regards to risktaking ,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2053,4442,each session of the womens leadership initiative program offers a new perspective on a different facet of leadership one overarching theme that i have noticed howevernbspis the importance of teamwork consistently our presenters have stressed the idea that it is not enough to simply push for personal growth and accomplishment but that as a leader you need to be always helping others succeed in our case much emphasis has been put on helping other women to succeednbsp one specific activity that resonated with me in regards to this topic was the game that we played in which there were buyers observers messengers and builders we were all tasked as a group to complete a job but we all played very different and individualized roles as the overall observer who was not able to communicate with the rest of the group i was truly able to gain an appreciation for the importance of working as one that activity reinforced for me the idea that it is not enough to simply be the best at your specific job if you are not doing what is in your power to help others succeed as wellnbsp i picked this topic not only because it was spoken about by nearly every guest speaker and in every session but because it resonates with me as a nursing student in my current role as a nursing assistant i am able to observe the teamwork and sometimes lackthereof of the nurses on my floor i can recognize that when a nurse is there to simply ldquodo her jobrdquo she is not providing the same level of care and attention as she could if she was working alongside her peers it is so important in the healthcare field to be able to rely on the people around you for support and encouragement in order to succeed the goals of the task at hand must be prioritized over your own personal gain i am thankful to have learned the importance of these things before i am officially in the field so that i can begin my career successfully and aid others in being successful as well as any good leader would donbsp nbsp,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2054,4427,we have discussed numerous beneficial topics regarding leadership within the wli sessions but the subject i found to be incredibly helpful was business etiquette ms frager educated the group about appropriate dining etiquette how to initiate a conversation starting with a proper handshake and what is seen as acceptable versus unacceptable when engaging in a conversation with another individual also ms frager informed us that an individual forms a first impression of another person in just  seconds and these impressions have the potential to affect future business endeavors and interactions these first impressions however are determined by characteristics such as posture and appearance as opposed to qualities of onersquos personality therefore it is crucial to demonstrate good manners and professional conduct when meeting someone new in the future i aspire to work as a healthcare professional in a clinical setting so i intend to put these skills to use anytime i encounter a new patient i believe that by exhibiting proper etiquette towards a patient i will display a level of professionalism and maturity and convey a message that i am competent and confident in my ability to treat them further if i were to ever find myself at a medical conference that took place over dinner i will be able to apply these skills and feel reassured that i have the knowledge and capability to represent myself in a professional way that is worthy of respect               normal                  false   false   false      enus   ja   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     style definitions  tablemsonormaltable 	msostylenametable normal 	 	 	msostylenoshowyes 	 	msostyleparent 	    	 	 	msopaginationwidoworphan 	 	fontfamilycambria 	msoasciifontfamilycambria 	msoasciithemefontminorlatin 	msohansifontfamilycambria 	msohansithemefontminorlatin     nbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2055,4451,nbsp nbsp nbspone of the womens leadership initiative fall sessions focused on risktaking and how it relates to leadership when i think of a leader i think of a strongwilled educated wellrespected person however i tend to forget that leaders are quite often risktakers as well i typically view risktaking as a scary endeavor because the outcome is uncertain and i tend to err on the side of caution when possible the main reason for that is my dislike of failure which i used to view in a negative light after hearing our guest speakers whom all hold leadership roles within their respective fields talk about failure as a learning experience rather than as a waste of time or resources my thoughts on risktaking changed nbsp nbsp nbspi now view risktaking as an opportunity to fail or to succeed both of which are beneficial succeeding is always beneficial because you have acheived your desired outcome however failure presents an invaluable learning opportunity by taking a risk and failing you are putting yourself out there learning from your mistakes and identifying areas of opportunity and growth for yourself and for your team after learning about the positive side of risktaking and failure i now feel that i can confidently lead myself and my team in the future through times of success and failure i feel this session inspired me to focus on the positives of any situation as well as to push myself out of my comfort zone both of which are necessary traits of a strong leader i am looking forward to my future as a leader when i can incorporate these learning experiences into lessons for my team as well as into the way i present myself and handle tasks in my career and my personal lifenbsp,0,1,1,0,0,psu

2057,4432,in womens leadership initiative i am learning that diversity in a group can be a benefit but a challenge diversity brings many different ideas different ways to achieve goals and to work together at the same time it can be a challenge because every person in each group comes from different backgrounds i believe that respect is the most important skill that comes to my mind that would solve this challenge i am not talking about understanding someones culture but respect it because it is even harder to understand in wli we talk a lot about respect and i believe that it is one of the most important and hardest skills to learnnbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2058,4433,over the last semester in the womens leadership initiative i have had the privilege of participating in a plethora of both eyeopening and worthwile activities with my fellow classmates i have been able to learn so much about those around me but also have grown to learn a great deal about myself i think i gained the most from analyzing my results from the meyersbriggs type indicator test i found the test to be very interesting and helpful in understanding how i approach life and the situations that i am presented with the test asks a series of questions and you answer each one using a scale after completion your results are given based on four different categories and you receive four letters to describe your type indicator the categories include whether you are an outwardly or inwardly focused person how you prefer to take in information how you prefer to make decisions and how you prefer to live your outer life my type indicator is infp based on these results i am an introvert who tends to take in information through intuition who prefers to make decisions based on feelings and who likes to live my outer life by perceiving i believe there are ups and downs to each of the different personality types and people with the same type are not going to be the same because each individual is unique however this test gave me a good idea as to who i am as a person both in my personal life and professionally these categories made it easy to examine what kind of leader i am how i work in a team and how i handle conflict i tend to be someone who leads by example and enjoys being a part of a team because i am introverted i want to do what is best for the most amount of people and i want to be seen as an equal i tend to avoid conflict not because it scares me but because i want to take the time to think through the situation and approach it in the best way possible and make the most people happy so therefore it takes me a while to make controversial decisions i think these results will help me to understand what areas i need to work on in order to become more comfortable in moving forward with my career and taking risks and in being more confident in myself during social situationsnbsp,0,0,1,0,1,psu

2060,3196,my favorite womenrsquos leadership topic discussed this past semester was the myersbriggs type indicator at the time i thought this was just another personality test like the ones you take on buzzfeed or facebook but after i got my results back i realized it was so much more when i saw that i was an infj introversion intuition feeling judging i didnrsquot understand what any of that meant but as i did more research and started reading about the character traits of the personality type i realized that i actually did fit the description infjs are the rarest of the  personalities the are motivated by values creating harmony and helping others in a grander scheme they are also introverts which contrary to popular belief means that while they can be bubbly and outgoing being in large groups or loud environments drains their energy levels quicker and is often intimidating and exhausting to even think about infjs are incredibly reflective and seek meaning behind their work although i at first didnrsquot realize the importance of myersbriggs irsquove come to realize how impactful understanding my own personality has helped me as a leader and a person often feeling left out or misplaced i never felt that i fit into a specific group of people regardless of how many friends i had and now i understand that can actually be attributed to my personality understanding my motivations as an infj has also helped me this past semester when reflecting upon past present and future work opportunities                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        wlsdexception lockedfalse     nameg,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2062,4440,through this past semester in wli several little tidbits of information have stuck with me after each session  phrases have really stuck withnbsp me from the women we have had the pleasure of having at our panel discussions the fiest phrase comes from our first panel discussion what is leadership when one of the woman told us to get comfortable with being uncomfortable this phrase reminded me of other cliche phrases that i was told when i was younger such as being told how important it is to take risks this really resonated with me because i realized that for any crucial changes to happen in your life you need to get out of your comfor zone if we are comfortable with being uncomfortable were constantly ready for the obstacles and challenges that are to come and are willing to take them head on to achieve what we want you need to get uncomfortable for progess to be made and it is realizing this fact that will set me apart from other leaders in the future the second phrase is from the most recent panel on risk taking and leadership where we were told that it is ok to not know everything and to ask for help i feel like it is important for every woman to hear thisnbspbecause we would like to think we have all the answers and were afrad that asking for help makes us look weak or unintelligent im at a point in my professional career where i am really developing myself as a leader and networking and making connections in this stage it is important for me to be familiar with the people i can look to for help i am willing to talk to and learn from any woman who has gone throuh the process i am going through now of trying to develop myself professional and applying to dietetic internships very soon everyones experience is different and asking for help can open your eyes to a different perspective that you maybe have not thought about keeping in mind that it is indeed ok to ask for help because i do not know everything will be crucial in future leadership roles because it will keep me humble as well as open to other peoples ideas and perspcectivesnbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2063,4447,for this entry i thought back to the first wli session besides the retreat i think one of the topics discussed during that session has reoccurred the most throughout this semester that topicactivity is the values assessment not only has it been reoccurring throughout wli sessions but throughout my other classes and extracurricular activitiesnbsp nbsp during the presentation and activity pertaining to assessing our values we had to start evaluating our values at a very broad level after convening and discussing our chosen values in a large group we had to eventually dwindle down our broad values to the values that mean the most to us these values are the values that make us who we are as individualsnbsp nbsp initially i started out with values such as family courage respect and integrity however in the end my core values were integrity service and excellence these are values that were presented to me as a freshman in air force rotc and what i have since chosen to live by the wli session instilled in me that these are the values that are most important to me i have since been more aware of how my values effect my leadership nbsp i want to lead and have people in my life who have similar core values to me people who have similar values are often easier to lead as they view life on the same level they respect each other innately because of what they hold dear to their hearts as mentioned a few days ago by the air force rotc cadre member that teaches another leadership class i am taking it is often impossible to lead people who dont have similar values and that is why the air force gives their personnel a set of values nbsp i learned since the wli presentation on values that i am very much a values driven leader i am driven by my own values integrity service and excellence and want each thing i do as an individual or as a part of a team to reflect upon those values however my values can also be a weakness in my leadership i have learned that in order to inspire and motivate people i must respect the differences between their values and mine nbsp in contrast to this my values can also be my greatest strength in leadership as i mentioned in my first written reflection for wli when leading i want to lead with confidence and poise in order to not only uphold my integrity but my teamrsquos integrity as well i believe that when you are in service to others you learn the most about yourself when leading i encourage altruistic acts for the betterment of internal and community relations i strive for excellence in everything i do and i definitely try to project that need for excellence onto my team while i believe that the need for excellence is one of my strengths it can often be the pitfall of my team depending on the goals put before us i therefore adjust my drive for excellence based on the general attitude of each team i leadrdquo nbsp in the future i hope to continue to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of being a value driven leader and what that means for how i lead people as a team as a future healthcare practitioner i think it is important to remain aware of what your values are because lack of awareness of values could negatively effect patientsrsquo outcomes it is also important to be aware of each patientrsquos values and their differences from yourrsquos in order to insure the most positive health outcome for the patient nbsp in terms of my own values i believe that they will all benefit patients in some way i have a desire to serve people and i believe service is important for development as an altruistic individual additionally i value integrity and living up to my mistakes while remaining true to myself and eventually patient outcomes lastly i value excellence not only for myself but for each patient and case i encounter i am driven to do my best for each patient i encounter while respecting their wishes and upholding my valuesnbsp,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2064,4452,during the first wli session in september we learned about core values and reflected on our own personal core values this activity was very impactful for me andnbspthe lessons that i learned have stuck with menbspthroughout this semesternbsp first of all i learned that core values are a set of values that determine which aspects of our life we regard as important while some of these core values are fixed others may change and develop as we reach different stages of life these values are often instilled in us at a young age through our families and communities but as we grow older it is important for us to define our core values for ourselves as these values will continue to guide the decisions that we make as leadersnbsp personally i learned that two of my core values are family and faith it is from these two values that many of my other values have been established for example my christian faith has compelled me to be compassionate and to love those around me furthermore it is my faith that has led me to pursue a career that allows me to advocate for social justice similarly from a young age my parents have instilled in me the importance of service and commitment to excellencenbsp having an understanding of my core principles of family and faith will help me to stay grounded as i continue on to pursue my professional goals reminding me of who i am and why i am doing what i am doing furthermorenbspi will use these core values to guide my decision makingnbsp in healthcare i will have to make many ethical decisions as i work work with patients and families using my core values i will seek to make decisions that are in the best interest of families i will also seek to make decisions that are consistent with my faith values such as treating patients with compassion and honoring others above myselfnbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2065,4446,in every interview in every application ive been faced with i could count on some variation of the same core question whats the plan its more of a questionnbspposed as a test than for me to actually plan out my career trajectory but knowing that hasnt stopped me from trying to do exactly that i tell people i live by my colorcoordinated google calendar and in the past ive even tried to schedule in sleep before it got too annoying to press ignore on the reminders that would pop up every night hours before i had finished my work nbsp in the hospitality industry especially you need to be flexible in where youll go or what youll do you can have an end goal in mind but a planned out path is rarely the one you can follow through on if you try to stick to a strict plan youre more likely to hinder your growth and miss out on opportunities than if you had just accepted the lateral but ultimately temporary position move more than anything you need to leave some room for a little risknbsp nbsp the women who spoke on the risk taking and leadership panel in november were nothing if not prime examples on nonlinear career paths and even nontraditional lives in regards to relationships and family regardless of the end goal or path they had set out with in mind or to what degree they had followed it they were all still accomplished confident women in their own right im still going to try to plan things out and keep my eye on my path just by nature but ultimately im going to focus on whats the best move for me in the moment im going to leave some room to jump knowing that a net will find me,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2066,2704,the fall semester is almost over which means that wli is about halfway done while i have learned so much these past few months through this program one of the most influential sessions instructed by my mentor stephanie mazzeocaputo she first told my class of her journey to find her career her struggle to find a career that she loved resonated with me as i have had difficulty identifying my passion and my ideal career for some time it was so reassuring to hear that many people grapple with this issue as well then after sharing her lsquosuccess principlesrsquo she displayed numerous cards each with a different selfaffirmation this was my favorite part of stephaniersquos session i often find it hard to give myself positive affirmation being able to select a card with an affirmation that spoke to me was a great lesson in practicing selflove i still recite the affirmation card that i chose ldquoas i move through the layers of other peoplersquos opinions and beliefs i see within myself a magnificent being wise and beautiful i love what i see in merdquo i am thankful to have had this opportunity to hear my mentor speak i am now more comfortable with my journey in discovering my ideal career and i practice selfaffirmation daily,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2068,4377,key strategies for getting a venture to the slope of enlightenment would be to find the right team get mentors and have a compelling story to tell  nbsp collectively the right team should be wellrounded in skills necessary for the venture there should be team members familiar with technology finances marketing and customer service if the team lacks any one of those skills the venture would have a higher chance of failure in tanzania the vision team had members from the college of engineering communications and business this allowed us to see problems from different points of view and create appropriate solutions that fit technology business and social constraints  nbsp mentorships are important because many students do not have enough experience to make a venture into a success having the right mentors for guidance and encouragement will allow me to avoid mistakes and make better decisions mentors can also bring their connections to the venture in our first week in tanzania the vision team was unsure of what to do our professors helped give us a direction with people to talk to and places to go because our professor already had connections in tanzania it allowed us to focus on our goals instead of making connections first nbsp a compelling story can help attract team members mentors and funding the members of the vision team all wear glasses so we understood the importance of accessible glasses also ventures need money to make it through the trough of disillusionment so it could help if the venture took advantage of the peak of inflated expectations to get more funding through investments investors would want to invest in something that they believe can be successful nbsp an example of a technology thatrsquos making a social and economic impact in the emerging economies is the cell phone cell phones allow people who donrsquot have access to landline to communicate and transfer money as explained in this article in emerging economies people are skipping landline and desktop computers and are going straight to cell phones because they donrsquot have access to landline a  pew research center survey states that around  of african households have landline a  survey states that around  of africans have cell phones  nbsp a person who leads a team through the trough of disillusionment should have the entrepreneurial mindset being comfortable with uncertainty and going against the status quo along with having confidence focus determination and curiosity being comfortable with uncertainty is important because there are a lot of uncertainties when starting a new venture the leader should be able to identify what is known and what isnt in order to minimize risks being able to go against the status quo allows the leader and the team to be creative in solving old problems the reason why certain problems are persistent is because the current solutions have not worked confidence focus and determination allow the leader to inspire the team to continue moving forward when times get hard curiosity drives people to constantly learn the more a leader knows the better equipped the venture is to succeednbsp  nbsp this knowledge informs my collaborators and i that there will be ups and downs in starting a venture and eventually the venture will grow in a steady rate just because something has never been done before it doesnrsquot mean that it canrsquot be donenbsp ,1,1,0,1,0,psu

2102,4431,as an international student one of the most frequently asked question has been what is the best part about being a penn stater initially i would reply the program the campus and the people  however after much thought i now reply saying  the connections and relationships built are what matter most to me as a student here i have met so many alumni including my mentors kevin frick and lynn hendrickson who are so willing to put in time and effort to get to know me as a person advice me on different matters and also taught me to give to other students the knowledge that they have passed on to me as a mentee to both these wonderful individuals i have had the incredible opportunity to hear about their experiences as students alumni professionals in healthcare and also as individuals who are trying to make an impact with their lives   for instance lynn once told me all about her early job experience and how different it was being on the other side and hiring students she also told me what she looked for in candidates and how someone could make a positive impression on the person they are interviewing with this was very helpful to me when i was applying to summer internships for the following year and would follow many of her tips such as being early being present and also making sure to follow up in the next  hours with an email and possibly a letter lynn and kevin also made the effort of talking to me and helping me prepare for my interviews   however my relationship with lynn and kevin wasnt just built around the premise of asking them for academic advice in fact the most beneficial part of being their mentee was simply learning more about them their ideologies and thoughts on life and people i have had several stimulating conversations on a plethora of topics including politics religion being a part of a community giving back and most importantly paying it forward according to kevin successful mentoring is to commit to make a difference that will be translated into a difference for others frick  to be a mentor to another means to be a resource a guide and above all to be vulnerable enough to pass on what you have learned my mentors helped me realise that in the mentoring process not every idea will work and not every bit of advice will be accepted but as long as both individuals attempt to make a difference they should be content frick    looking forward i hope to continue my relationships with both my mentors and have them as my confidantes and someday friends there will be times i will approach them seeking advice about a particular issue but for me the more important aspect of this partnership is the respect friendship and memories that are shared together    references frick k  defining successful mentorship retrieved from ,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2105,3196,nbsp nbsp nbspthe past two and a half years have been focused on my personal developement finding out who i am what my strengths are what i wanted to be and how i am going to get there but throughout  i began a new journey in my life focusing my energy towards development outwardsnbsp nbsp nbsp nbspmidway through the year i was paired with a womens leadership mentor kathy misunas kathy was everything i pictured myself to be she had been the head of a company board member of many committess world traveler respected and adored by many and most importantly  a philanthropist i had the opportunity to meet kathy at her home by the east river in nyc before the semester started during our time together and through our conversations thereafter i have learned a lot about humility and selflessness thought kathy is known as a business famous woman she never once brings up her accolades or achievements during our exchanges instead she listens and she asks me strategic questions that make me think deeper about my purpose and meaning behind my actions she is someone who has been so generous with her time and advice without expecting anything in returnnbsp nbsp nbsp nbspbefore entering my junior year of college i used to think life was a competition with myself and most prominently with others but as i continue to focus on inward reflection and meaning to my work ive come to realize that the only person i have to compete with is the person i was yesterday and even then its okay to not constantly be propelling miles forward in life sometimes focusing on and helping others ends up helping me grow as a person faster than i could have on my ownnbsp nbsp nbsp nbspfor the second half of  i began mentoring underclassmen hospitality students one as an official mentee and others whose need for guidance appeared naturally in front of me through haveing kathy misunas and other professionals in my life as such impactful examples of mentorship i became able to genuinely give unrequitted advice and service to other students without feeling threatened or jealous and at the end of the day it helped me develop stronger patience and empathy skillsnbsp nbsp nbsp nbspmentorship has helped support my growth as a person exponentially throughout the past two and a half years and im finally at a point in my own life that i can continue to take on that role for others in a positive and genuine waynbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2106,4417,we started off our spring semester with jennifer crosss presentation on adaptive leadership this presentation was full of self reflection and new ways of viewing scenarios that had never even crossed my mind she highlighted how we often want to change others and wish others would do this differently and that differently we hardly ever reflect on oursevles and ask oursevles what we could do differently to get a different outcome her session made me reflect on how i lead and what personality traits shine through in my leadership style we played personality poker which was such a fun and interesting way to pinpoint our leadership style after breaking off into groups i found the most constructive part of the exercise to benbspwhen we constructively criticizednbspeach group on what bothers us about their leadership style but then we offered suggestions on how we could change our style to work better together it seems intuitive that we need to adapt our leadership styles depending on the people we are working with but when it boils down to it we just dont we are stuck in our ways and think its our way or the highway and thats when there are communication breakdowns and nothing gets accomplished if everyone would reflect on their own style and work to tailor their leadership a little bit depending on their audience we would get a lot more done i found this presentation very helpful and im very excited to attempt to adapt my leadership style the next time i am presented with people who do not think in the same ways i do leadership is about more than getting everything done the way you think is best its always a team effort and more often than not people have ideas that may be better than the one you are thinking of if you take the time to listen and work with others there are many kinds of leaders one style is not better than the other so we need to value each style and opinion and work together to find the best solution adaptive leadership is an important concept for each leader to understand and i am very thankful for the opportunity to learn about it during our first sessionnbsp,0,0,1,1,1,psu
2107,4419,through the womens leadership initiative i have had the opporunity of bonding and keepingnbspin touch with a personal mentor this mentorship has been very beneficial for me throughout wli because it turned out to be a very valuable relationshipnbspwhat i have learned about mentoring is that it requires teamwork initiative and communication i would not have been able to build a relationship with my mentor unless i took the initiative responsibility and time out of my day to email here every now and then initiative is a very important part in maintaining a mentorship especially if it the mentor and mentee are unable to meet in person for the majority of the time teamwork goes along with this because without the effort of both parties in the mentorship the relationship would be nonexistent it takes two for the relationship to be a long and meaningful one in addition communication is a key part of mentorship because without communicating or emailing each other there will be no progress ornbspmutual understanding between the mentor and mentee nbsp through my relationship with my wli mentor i have been able to better understand my leadership style by reflecting on my experiences at the sessions and events in order to informnbspmy mentor about my development and the knowledge that i am gaining i plan to utilize this mentorship throughout my life by maintaining the relationship and remembering the comprehension of my selfknowledge which will be beneficialnbspin my future leadership roles as a graduate student and occupational therapistnbsp nbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu

2109,3156,i will never look at a deck of cards the same ever again when jennifer cross had the class perform an exercise during the first wli session of the spring semester i didnt know what to expect after we all traded a set of novelty playing cards to get our perfect hand i thought we would just self reflect at first i wasnt very impressed my inner monologue was saying i know i am extroverted and compassionate thats what ive been hearing all last semester but as she classified us into our suits i began to see the big picture i was standing next to girls with whom i shared similar values i was standing across the room from girls who also shared the same values but expressed them in a different way that is what adaptive leadership is all about jennifer taught us that adaptive leadership is an enhancement of recognizing the strengths and weaknesses in others it is anticipating how others will approach a situation and using that knowledge to provide them with the resources to succeed this exercise helped me to understand that there is more than one right way to approach a task and my approach might not always be the most efficient and thats okay now that i understand adaptive leadership i can better relate to people of all suits and i can become a much more effective leader,0,0,0,1,1,psu
2110,4438, during our january  womenrsquos leadership initiative session we were lucky to have a presentation on adaptive leadership presented by jennifer cross through a combination of a talk and breakout group activities we learned the importance of this leadership skill and how we can better incorporate it into our own leadership style  adaptive leadership is the art of learning about your team membersrsquo individual skills and personalities and changing your leadership style to meet their needs however it does not mean that you have to forfeit the leadership style you feel most comfortable with it simply means that you should be open to exploring new avenues to find the greatest success  adaptive leadership involves understanding yourself as much as it involves understanding others by learning how you best work you can better recognize and appreciate the unique skills of others and how you can best adapt to work with them during our personality poker activity i discovered that i was creative and peopleoriented which aligns well with other personality assessments and what i understand about myself  while learning about our own personalities through personality poker was interesting and fun what was most beneficial to me was learning how to constructively adapt to the other personality types we were encouraged to write down our ldquopet peevesrdquo about the other groups and then spin them positively we discovered that even though some things may bother us it does not mean that they are inherently bad some people just work differently than us and we as leaders need to appreciate the unique viewpoint our colleagues bring to the table  now that i better understand the importance of adaptive leadership it is up to me to develop this skill that is why i am thankful for all of the leadership opportunities available to me at penn state i have had the privilege of being able to work with a wide variety of people each with their own distinct skill set after our adaptive leadership session i want to make it a personal priority to adapt my own leadership style to better appreciate and work with those around me diversity of people and ideas in the workplace leads to incredible things it takes a strong leader to both see the merit in everyonersquos work and bring these innovative ideas together to make something great that is why adaptive leadership is so important this leadership skill can lead to better harmony and efficiency in work settings if everyone feels valued for their unique skills they will be more inclined to produce quality work leading to better group results if a leader knows how to adapt to the team that they were given success will come naturally,0,0,1,1,0,psu
2111,4441,during our last womens leadership session we participated in a presentation on adaptive leadership prior to this seminar i had given little thought on how i should alter my leadership style to fit the needs of those with whom i am working i tend to have an intense determined competietive style of leadership which i now realize may not be effective in all situations after discovering the many different personalities and leadership styles i am more comforatble adapting my leadership tactics in order to be a more effective and compassionate leader learning to recognize different personalities will be incredibly beneficial in determing the needs of a groupnbsp,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2112,4437,my mentoring partnership has proven to be one of the most beneficial aspects of wli for me before joining wli i had no idea what i wanted to do when i graduate immediately my mentor amanda reached out to me and we got the chance to talk over the phone we talked for a very long time about my life in the present and where i hope to go in the future and she instantly assured me that shed help me do research and connect me to people who would be good connections for menbsp after talking with her and doing some searching of my own i finally came to decide that i want to be a speech pathologist while this isnt really a field thats included in my major im confident that with the skills ive learned through wli and with the help of amanda i will be able to accomplish this goalnbsp i have learned so much through my time with her she is so passionate about helping me and so eager to see me succeed which helps me to feel more secure in what im doing this relationship will stick with me for many years to come and i hope that in the future i can be a mentor for others and do for them what amanda has done for me i am also going to take this experience and use it as a reminder to constantly take advantage of the connections i have and to be continually building my network amanda has connected me to so many people who have taught me so much about their paths in life and their careers and it has opened me up to a whole new world of opportunity so moving forward i will be very sure to keep up with the connections i build and use them to my advantage while also working to help others who find themselves in situations similar to my ownnbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu

2115,4450,having a mentor who is in your career path is important but having a mentor who you can trust seek advice from and rely on for support is more important i received a mentor who fits that description she is a physical therapist and was in my position just a few years ago i can approach my mentor with a simple question such as when did you start applying to graduate school or with a complex question such as honbsp how did you know that  years in school to become a physical therapist is what you were meant to do and with either question i know i am receiving an honest answer having a mentor has been extremely beneficial because it is nice having someone who has gone through it all before when i think about grad school applications future jobs and life after school it can become overwhelming but having a mentor who has conquered all of it takes a way some fears i learned that mentoring works both ways while i am seeking help from an admirable individual they can also learn a lot from myself it helps them be reminded of their goals and why they chose the career path so it is a winwin situation i always plan to maintain mentorships but to also create new ones one day i hope i can be a mentor through wli or another program so i can make an impact on someone who is in the position i am now understanding that mentorship is a about guidance is key by being involved in a mentorship one can exercise their leadership skills in many ways mentors can turn to adaptive leadership to know that everyone is different but can also use their strengths to produce the best outcome possible overall mentorship is important in professional development and is something that i believe is useful in any life situationnbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2116,4449,recently i attended a presentation by jennifer cross on adaptive leadership from the presentation i learned a lot about what adaptive leadership is and how to incorporate it into my leadership style adaptive leadership was defined by jennifer cross as a practical leadership framework that helps individuals and organizations adapt and thrive in diverse and challenging environments it supports a culture of innovation which helps to eliminate concrete thinking lastly adaptive leaders are able to be successful working with anyone in any setting one aspect discussed in the lecture that was significant to me is that it is important to reframe your thinking ndash instead of expecting people to do a task a certain way you want ask what you can do relating to that jennifer shared with us a quote ldquotreat others the way they would want to be treatedrdquo i feel this quote really encompasses a lot of what i learned from the presentation which was incorporating every personsrsquo unique personality on a team as an adaptive leader it is so important to lead with the style of the person you are working with and frame things in a way that resonates with them  nbsp                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    wlsdexception lockedfalse  namegrid table ,0,0,0,1,1,psu

2185,4435,i recently attended a session on quieting my inner critic as apart of a weekend workshop help by the womens leadership initiative this talk was extremely helpful and informative we learned that almost everyone has an inner critic and the only difference is that some people let it diminsh them i learned that my inner critic is a task master so i never feel like i can check enough tasks off the list this causes me to neglect my work life balance to get to the bottom of my todos we came up with a few ways to help silence that inner critic i will set daily goals instead of weekly since i often find myself working like crazy to do a whole weeks worth of work in a few days also i will make an effort to celebrate small successes with rewards like some me time or a night out with friends we learned it is important to acknowldge our inner critic by saying i hear you but im choosing to ignore you i think it is really nbspimportant to be aware of because so many times i can feel myself in my own way but now i have strategies to overcome that self doubt in the future i will keep this in mind and push myself to keep my inner critic in check,0,0,1,0,1,psu
2186,4966,i never considered that i would dance it was something that interested me but i was too scared to try i never thought my body could move to music well or that i could count the beats however at the end of my senior year in high school my friend had shown me a music video of a kpop dance saying the group looked so good dancing this sparked a tiny motivitation in me as i wanted to appear cool i tried learning the dance on my own looking up every possible tutorial i could find it took a while and wasnt that clean but i managed to soak in the movements for the dance and once i did i had a feeling of satisfaction that i accomplished something i never thought of previously i continued learning dances i liked and found out that i also really enjoyed the process of learning new things which some people may have thought to be cumbersome and time consuming by this time i was already attending penn state therefore i was looking up a club related to kpop where i found my current club kpmd i quickly joined only to realize my shy self having a difficult time talking to the members or even participating however a lot of the members reached out to me first and encouraged me to participate more i quickly became more involved eventually joining the performance team i managed to perform in a number of events becoming closer with the members and becoming familiar with learning the dances soon i found myself feeling pretty confident in dancing and ended up even becoming a coordinator for some dance performances and a dance teacher for general meetings within a year of joining overall thanks to this club i managed to learn how fun dancing can be as well as most of my closest friends in college,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2187,4966,when coming into college i was a chemical engineering major in highschool i enjoyed chemistry so i planned on doing something related i also loved building stuff or creating something with planning so i believed engineering was my path i quickly realized chemical engineering wasnt right for me the classes i took were not interesting for me and i began to lose motivation because i felt that this was something i did not want to do for the rest of my life or even college career i decided to look for other options something i was always interested in but never thought i could do well was computers i was always into the coding aspect as well but always thought it was something i would never be able to do i thought i couldnt lose anything for trying and started looking more into it i narrowed it down to computer science and ist which were related to computers and possible coding because of issues with how i would need to schedule computer science was out of the picture therefore i looked more into ist and all the descriptions about the major and the courses in the major seemed fun and something i would want to do i was scared and hesitant but because i thought i would need to take risks to find what i wanted to do in life i switched majors after taking ist classes for about  semesters i can confidently say that the major is much better suited for me than my old major i enjoy all my classes and believe i am learning valuable things everyday although i still dont have much experience or knowledge it feels as though i have a better grasp of what i want to do in the futurenbsp,0,1,1,0,0,psu
2188,4445,one aspect of wli is being matched with a female mentor who has experience in a field of interest in order to gain experience in facilitating professional conversations while fostering a good relationship with the mentor i went into this experience thinking that my mentor would be a great source of guidance and information as well as a professional reference which has happened however my mentor means more to me than thatnbsp through regular communication with my mentor we have been able to form this friendship and find common interests that we both share this relationship has benefitted me professionally and has exceeed my expectations of what a strong female mentor can teach me i have learned things about myself that i would not have learned without her help and been able to believe in myself and all my accomplishments in a way i havent been able to before i have learned a lot about mentoring over the past two semesters and my main takeaway is that the mentee is the driver of the relationship i was very open and adamant in reaching out to my mentor and letting her know that i wanted to form a good relationship with her which i think is very important my mentor was able to feed off of my excitement and desire to get to know her and we have since built a strong relationship that i can see continuing into the future long past graduation nbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2189,4448,through the womens leadership initiative i was able to visit our state capital in harrisburg to speak with current female leaders who work in government in the nonprofit sector and also who run their own companies i learned about how important hard work is to getting where i would like to go not one of the successful women who spoke appeared to have an easy path to get to where she was each woman was inspiring in her own way truly leaving an impression on me because of the dedication she had to achieving all she has and to become such an incredible leader in her respective field one of the panelists spoke about the importance of having confidence in our abilities and reaching out of our comfort zone she referenced the statistic that most women will not apply for a job unless they meet  of the qualifications while men will typically apply when they meet only  of the qualifications this panelist explained to us the importance of reaching for those jobs where we may still need to learn a bit because we could be everything that employer is looking for further one of the speakers representative kim spoke about the separation of conflict at work versus personal conflict it is critical that we learn to fight for our beliefs and ideas at work even against people who disagree however we should not hold personal grudges or negative feelings against these people instead we must honor their opinions and work to maintain positive communication and respect overall i was primarily impacted by the confidence empowerment and complete intelligence of each of these women they were so passionate and knowledgable in their respective fields and simply listening to their examples left me incredibly inspired             nbsp      normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        wlsdexception lockedfalse priori,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2195,4416,at the last womens leadership initiative session on march  we participated in a self defense class at first i was a little weary going into something that seemed aggressive and unappealing however self defense is valuable skill that everyone should be familiar with of course i hope i will never have to use it but after thinking it over and listening to the police women speak i felt accepting and excited to learn i enjoyed being able to participate in this activity with my classmates even though self defense can be scary it makes it much more comfortable learning it as a group and with your friends we went over problem solving techniques if someone is holding you in a specific way we learned skills and maunvers for each of those this experience has shaped my leadership development both physically and mentally physically i feel able to remove myself from tough situations or even help a friend i grew confidence in participating in this session being short in stature often times limits me but being able to be in control and knowing that i can react and have tools up my sleeve made me more confident ultimately improving my leadershipnbspmentally i feel stable i was fearful of the self defense class but participating in a safe place with friends i respect made the task easier and fun i feel that the conifence i built in this session is something that can not be taken from me i did not think learning self defense would make me feel prepared and fearless in conclusion i am going to remember to not judge a book by its cover something that made me feel uneasy ended up being a positive i plan to better my leadership skills by welcoming tasks with open arms and being optimistic remebering to step out of my comfort zonenbsp nbsp,0,1,0,0,0,psu
2196,4963, beginning my employment career i found out very quickly that it was important to practice and use proper customer service skills i gained acknowledgment of this when customers sought out to engage in a sale or interaction with me rather then my other employees eventually impressing my boss enough to raise my pay grade and position to manager early on in my career this boosted my confidence proving that if you positivity treat people and are proactive in difficult work situations positive outcomes will follow expected or unexpectedly this experience has always made me put the customer before the company and myself in order to provide the best possible experience for the customer nbsp,0,0,1,1,1,psu
2197,4452,a few weeks ago our wli class took a trip to the pennsylvania state capital in harrisburg where we heard from various women leaders in business and government our first session was a panel discussion on ethics in leadership with four state representatives one of the panelists that really stood out to me during this session was representative patty kimnbsp nbsp representative kim first introducted herself as aunt patty the name she is referred to by the citizens in her district the majority of whom live below the povertynbspline right off the batnbspi could tell that shenbspwas someone who leads with compassion and humility she went on to share how she grew up in a privileged enviornment came into college as a nursing majornbspbut that a somewhat windy road eventually led her to pursue a position in office she talked about how growing up with privilege gave her a certain perspective on life that she was forced to break down when she began working with a vulnerable population she talked about the need to recognize your frame of reference and realize when that gets in the way of the work that you are trying to do this is something that i really related to as someone who grew up with privilege but has the desire to advocate for indivudals living in poverty it reminded me that the first step in advocating for a community isnbspbeing ablenbspto relate to the people that you are serving nbsp another thing that representive patty said that stood out to me is that she has the quality of empathy and that she used to view empathy as a weakness but has come to recognize it as a strength in the work that she does this was very encouraging to me as someone who is also very empathetic but often feel that showing empathy makes me look too sensitive or too much like a pushover i realized that empathy is something that i can use to help me better relate to people in order to make a positive difference in peoples livesnbsp nbsp overall i admire representative patty kim as a women who truly practices servantleadership and i learned a lot about how i can use my natural strengths as a leader to advocate for vulnerable populations and make a real difference in a communitynbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2198,4436,when i received a mentor i also gained a friend a confidante and an advisor someone who could explain the ins and outs of situations i couldnt figure out myself and alleviate my fears over the future my mentor has already completed nursing school received her rn worked in a picu and an or and even switched to a patient safety role she has experienced so much more than i have as a nurse and i continually look to her for guidance about decisions regarding my future jobs as she has already lived through this process i feel like i have gained not only knowledge from her but confidence as well she has encouraged me through many applications even when i doubt myself i could not have asked for a better mentornbsp i have learned that a mentor doesnt always have to be doing exactly what you want to do when you graduate they could already have done your preferred job or know about a specific hospital or even just the job application process in general my mentors insight into summer internships has been extraordinarily beneficial and has alleviated a lot of my concerns over it ive also learned that a mentor can be just professional in nature or it can also be personal setting the boundaries is what makes the relationship into one or the other and i think it is definitely important to set those ive learned to never be afraid to ask questions because your mentor is here to share their knowledge with you and as long as you are respectful of them and their other commitments they are generally willing to answer any questionnbsp throughout my life i think having various mentors will help guide my professional goals and the risks im willing to take getting an opinion from someone you trust especially someone that has experience in your field can only help you make the right decisions to reach your goal i believe i will always strive to keep in contact with my mentors even as i create relationships with new ones because not only can i build a network of people i trust and that have more experience than i do but i can also gain knowledge from every single one of them that will benefit me in the long runnbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2199,4437,i learned an incredible amount of information from the inspirational women we got to meet on march  in harrisburg one of the biggest takeaways from that day for me personally was how complex the journey can be to finding where you fit so many of the women that spoke talked about how many jobs they worked and steps they took until they fell into something they love i have spent so much time contemplating my path and trying to figure out where i would fit best having the opportunity to hear these women speak about all of the roadblocks they hit but still ending up successful was very inspirationalnbsp another thing i will never forget from this day was about not waiting to be asked a lot of the women discussed how they came into a position after someone asked them to apply or told them that they thought they could do it after doing some reflection on this i realized that this is something i do a lot too i often become interested in something but then i begin to doubt my abilities and decide to move on unless someone else sees the potential in me when i compare this to a lot of my male friends however they are fully aware of their abilities and are eager to try and see what happens it is important as female leaders that we are able to recognize our own strength and believe in ourselves while its good that others might help push us to our full potential we may miss out on a lot of opportunities if we have to wait for someone else to recognize our abilitiesnbsp after all of these panel discussions i feel like i will be able to continue on in my leadership roles with confidence i will be able to look back to the conversations we had with so many successful women and remember that it is okay to fail and it is also okay to have the confidence to push ourselves to advance in our careersnbsp,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2200,4440,many of the speakers and presenters i have admired the most thus far during my wli experience have been those who found themselves in careers and jobs that were different from they saw themselves doing in the future by this i mean they were studying one thing in college tried a couple jobs out in that field decided it wasnt what they wanted to do did countless other jobs to figure out what it was they wanted and ended up somewhere completely different doing what they actually love in almost every woman who has said this their initial field wasnt neccessarily something they werent interested in but it wasnt what they were passionate about it wasnt making them excited to wake up everyday or light some sort of fire under them and this is why they craved something elsenbsp nbsp two women who stuck out to me during our past trip to harrisburg were representative patty kim andnbspjudge susan e schwab because they experienced the events i mentioned in the paragraph abovenbspjudge schwab was selling carpets for a living then found herself appointed tonbspchief magistrate judge susan e schwab after spending years not knowing what she wanted to do or ever seeing herself in law rep patty kim was playing lacrosse and studying journalismcommunications and college and now she is a member of the pennsylvania house of representativesnbsp nbsp not only do i think it is inspiring to hear these stories from successful women but important for young women my age to also hear i believe that the society we live in now and at a especially stressful and competitive time such as junior year we are told tonbspgraduate high school go to college get a good degree and arrive at the end goal of having a good job this has been drilled into our minds ever since a young age this process is extremely linear and goes directly from point a to point b without taking into consideration everything that happens in the inbetween kids my age are told that if we follow these steps and do well in school that these things will happen no one ever talks about the people who dont know what they want to do or want to explore different options or like what happened to rep patty kim no longer wanted to do what she studied in college anymore people are human and we should be allowed to change our minds without criticism and society telling us it all has to be done a certian way she realized her passion was helping people and one of her main skills was empathy and she needed to find a career where she could exel in these areas and really shine in what shes good at and to this day she loves what she does and wouldnt change it for the worldnbsp nbsp i will say i have had these hesitataions and questioned what i have been studying the throughout my college career a lot this year this is the year where the future is getting closer and becoming a reality instead of just a conversation i love nutrition and have always been passionate about it and still am but i can genuinely say that when the times got hard i really thought i wasnt cut out to study this field anymore i questioned what i wanted to do with mynbspmajor and if all the steps in between were worth it i thought to myself do i really want to do what ive been saying i want to do all this time i thought do i want to study something more in the liberal arts like psychology or philosophy while these were always thoughts of interest real life factors obivously got in the way of any thoughts of me swtiching my major like finances and not being able to afford the additional years of undergrad that would follow with switching my majornbspbecause of my feelings hearing stories from these women who explain that either they completely changed their career path or just ended up somewhere completely differnet have been extremely inspiring to me because it reassures me that there is room to change your mind and still be successful and not having to follow a perfectly linear path they reassured me that it is ok to not follow this rigid path set by society nbsp while i am still studying nutrition and am still passionate on the subject i definitley do not want to follow a conventional path in the major and want what i do with it to be different from everyone else i eventually want to have a private practice that incorporatesnbspa holistic plant based diet psychology and yogameditation to contribute to an overall wellness i rememebr that what i want to do with the major is help people and that is genuinely what keeps me going everyday i think of what i want to do in the future and it makes it all worth it meeting nutrition professionals in the work force who are doing these types of things i want to do is exciting and makes me want to work even harder nbsp so in conclusion i was inspired to hear from successful women who did not follow a perfect linear path they let their passion and self reflection of what they were good at guide where they would be in the future hearing from these women reminds me that its ok to go in different directions and be different from those telling you that it has to be done in a certain way knowing this i will be open to exploring different areas of the field becasue there is always the possibility that it will land me in a career better than what i couldve imaginednbsp nbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2201,3156,in my opinion the mentoring partnership i received from joining wli is the best part of the whole program it was the easiest networking experience i have ever had because my mentor was handpicked for me from the wli instructors my mentor is sharon power she is a selfemployed hr consultant and executive coach embedded into her career are the qualities of guidance and support which are qualities that make her a perfect mentor the first time i met sharon in person she could not have been more welcoming she treated me with the upmost respect yet was very nurturing in her tone and demeanor we connected instantly and i was grateful to be paired with such a great mentor in our conversations regardless of the medium sharon has always been supportive of me and has always been willing to give me advice i have always felt welcomed to approaching her with any questions or to seek advice sharon has been a mentor in this program for five years and she told me she keeps in touch with all of her mentees i am very optimistic that we will maintain a relationship long after my time in this program ends i will be very excited to update her about my professional milestones and other events in my life i intend to utilize her mentorship in the future because she has been very successful in her own career so i know her advice will be sound,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2202,4438,womenrsquos leadership initiative had the privilege of going to the pennsylvania state capitol to meet with female leaders in a variety of different positions from elected representation to nonprofit work while each of our panel discussions brought such unique perspectives and valuable information one panel in particular stood out to me the judicial panel while i do not have an interest in a career in law i thought that the women on the panel had such interesting stories and were so candid with us about their experiences they did not shy away about anything if we asked them a question they spoke about it as honestly and openly as they could they gave such valuable advice for any woman looking to stand out in her field the first thing that really resonated with me is that it is ok to have a nontraditional career path each of the women took vastly different routes to become judges and no single path was the correct way to get there they learned to adapt and find success in their own ways which is incredibly admirable a second point that stood out to me was how they emphasized that you can both be a successful female leader and a successful mother so often we as women are told that you must either choose a career or a family however the panelists made it clear that they have never prioritized one over the other you can achieve a balance of professional life and family life it takes work but it can be done and done well the judicial panel was comprised of three incredible female leaders who were so willing to share their stories with us i greatly appreciated the opportunity to listen to them speak i hope to one day be as skilled in my field as they are and have the opportunity to guide young female leaders as they did,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2203,4450,i was recently able to travel to harrisburg to spend a day at pennsylvanias state capital while there i was able to explore the historic building see where judges and senators spend their time and meet with a variety of the people who work had to serve pa meeting with judge patricia mccullough judge susan schwab and judge jeannine turgeon was a highlight of the day they were such powerful woman and openly shared their stories i learned that no matter what career path or future endeavours i experience i must possess passion in my work life and personal life passion will lead the way when they decided being a judge was their calling they stepped up putting their lives on hold and went for it they spoke about surrounding yourself with people you can reflect with a career is a a major part of life and sharing your experiences with people is a great way to destress and move forward a lot of these admirable woman talked about how important it is to hold high standards and to act in an ethical manner remaining professional in the work world will exemplify leadership people will trust you if you lead by example which is what i plan to do overall the trip to harrisburg taught me a lot on how to be a respected leader i look forward to the time i can be a leader in my careernbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu
2204,4432,on friday wli went to the capitol in harrisburg pa we talked to many interesting people and i learned a lot throughout the day in this entry i want to talk about the most important takeaways of the trip  first representative paty kimnbspsaid that we need to find a job that suits with our passion so that you perform it at your best level and it does not seem like work representative patty kim said that you can apply your passion for many different jobs not just in one for example her passion is helping people and she thought that being a nurse is the most effective way to help people so she went to nursing school later she found out it was not her passion and she thought about being a state representative because she could still help people  another thing that i learned from the panelists is that leaders have to be willing to do the work that they give to other people this changed my view of leadership because i thought that a staff member was supposed to do things that managers or leaders do not want to do for example making copies and run around the office after this statement now i can identify bad leaders and good leaders for example this winter i worked as a ski teacher and my manager never delegated boring and heavy duties to us rather he would do them and we helped him in the future i hope to have good managers and as a leader i will pay attention in not to make my staff do what i do not want to do  another thing that i learned from the trip is to surround myself with brilliant people because they can help me to succeed i also believe that the people who surround you tell a lot about who you are therefore it is better to be around amazing people who offers you a lot of insights and opportunities that make you grow after this the moment i arrived at penn state i texted a brilliant friend from last year and met up with her because i believe she helps me to become a better person nbsp another important thing that i learned is not to wait to be asked but just do it this changed my view about me as a leader because i thought that i had to wait to be asked if i wanted another position i always thought this because i do not want to sound cocky in the workplace and i do not want the others to think that i am doing better than them also most of the time i do not feel that i am able to be in an higher position instead all of the panelists suggested us not to wait to be asked and i found it really inspiring it gave me the strength to speak up because i now know that it is right to do so ,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2210,2704,on the weekend of march  my wli class held our second weekend workshop on the  we had the opportunity to travel to harrisburg and engage in panel discussions with leading lawmakers and enforcers in the pennsylvania government on the  we learned various aspects of selfdefense and were able to explore aspects of a concept called the inner critic i learned that the inner critic is a voice of unfounded criticism that everyone experiences and was able to identify the ways in which my own inner critic manifests perhaps most importantly i learned ways to manage my inner critic so that it does not affect my leadership i am so grateful for this session regarding the inner critic because in past leadership experiences there have been situations in which i let my own inner critic guide my decisionmaking and influence the way that i led which often hindered the progress of the group and of my own leadership growth being aware of what the inner critic is and how to manage itnbsparenbspincredible tools that i cannot wait to employ when i lead in the future,0,0,1,0,1,psu

2213,4446,i generally find myself in an all or nothing situation when it comes to my commitments and i usually choose all i always choose all in a major as competitive as mine and with a personality as competitive as mine its hard to allow myself room for some nothing the taskmaster in me continuously pushes me to do more and if im not always doing something to work towards or achieve my goals it means inevitable failure  my my mentor and i have had conversations about self care and what it really means recently it isnt always bubble baths and chocolates and rarely do those things actually help you in the long term true self care is about striking a balance in everything you do learning when having the diligence to do your work will give you more peace of mind versus when to stick up for yourself to your boss and tell them you need a break its also about knowing when to allow yourself a guiltfree goalless break to do nothing but something for yourself mainly by quieting your inner critic i always think i need to be doing something more even when im already multitasking or ive had a particularly productive day by recognizing that and reminding myself that taking a break helps me be healthier and more productive in the long term i can enjoy choosing nothing for once,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2215,4424,harrisburg is one of the leading cities in pennsylvania housing some of the most extraordinary women leaders it was only fitting that it was there that i learned some of the most important things about leadership that i will continue to carry with me for the rest of my life one of the most profound things that i learned while at this workshop was to get out instead of make it work this was quite interesting for me as most of our lives we are told to keep trying until we reach our goal therefore this statement made by quite a few leaders in attendance that day was counterinuitive and made me think deeper into what was actually being said i now understand that we try to force some things even when we know its not going to happen instead we can use that same time and energy into something that will be more beneficial and productive this is certainly true when it comes to ethics the culture of an organization is very difficult to change so it is better if you get out of a company that does not share your beliefs and values and go work for one that does by doing this you can grow up in an environment that supports you while not going against your morals another thing that i learned related to this same principle is not to swing at every pitch we need to learn what we can and cannot take on and what is most important to us so that we are spending our time efficiently on things that matter while many of these things that are discussed seem to oppose what we have learned in the past i believe that they are essential to being a successful leader in the future,0,0,0,0,0,psu

away from the window that i was peering out of having been the last one off the plane i could take my time to gather my thoughts for the first time since take off in state college pennsylvania about  hours ago trying to call up all the research that i have done on the country and its customs i stepped out into the sea of people in the middle of bangkok international airport in thailand for the first time in my life the unfamiliar thai writing was daunting as i navigated through customs and picked up my luggage after a maze of turns i made it out to the pick up area of arrival and searched for the face of my boss for the upcoming three months memories flooded back to me of the first time that i read about her company online and the daring email that i sent to her asking for her to take a chance by giving a college freshman who hasnt settled on his major at the time an internship with her upcoming company the exchange of conversation and two interviews that i went through flashed by and all of a sudden i saw her inperson for the first time nbsp stepping out of her mercedes she approached me and reached out her hand introducing herself as ms abby chantanton ceo of abby dabby cosmetics inc the car ride into the city went by in a flash as she introduced herself further and talked about what i was going to do at her company it was at this moment that i felt lost to the world doubt crept across my mind about my ability to help her company and tackle the tasks that she has laid out for me nbsp after a night of rest i woke up uncertainly trying to decide what the typical dress code was for the job luckily i was living at the company house with other employees of the company so i poked my head out and knocked on the door adjacent to mine across the hall and met noona for the first time she informed me in an accented english that i should wear a button down and some khaki shorts since the weather here was so hot nbsp after getting dressed i went downstairs and found the small group of employees that live here gathered waiting for me noona kindly introduced me to the four other employees and took me out to eat a quick breakfast before walking the quick five minutes to worknbsp nbsp from then forward that was the routine that i followed on a daily basis for three months constantly being with the company employees for all meals and i began to form a bond with a group of people that barely spoke english my task at the company varied day to day and was not as daunting as i had first realized on my drive in with ms abby on monday wednesday and friday i worked exclusively with ms abby to attend business meetings with cexecutives from other companies and factories that our company is partnered with since a lot of the meetings were in english which is the unofficial trade language of asia i was tasked with taking notes and then explaining things in a more simple way to ms abby that afternoon the clients that we meet with during those days also come from europe to develope their products and would communicate with me in english which i would later explain in more detail to ms abbynbsp nbsp on tuesday and thursday of each week i would have meetings with the design team and it development team with the design team i was tasked with explaining to them on a more simple basis on what clients want with certain products that they are developing through our company with the it development team i learned to code the website that they are putting up for clients and updating products on the sites of other clients nbsp there were also days where there would be promotional events that i would be called to attend such as expositions showcasing our company products with english tourists one of the more prominent project that i worked with was the mont bleu perfume where i was tasked specifically with the research and design of the upcoming perfume i started with base sketches on paper then translating that to graphics design and a marketing panel to present to my boss for approval nbsp my time with abby dabby cosmetics inc has really set the tone and given me the push that i needed to decide what i wanted to do for my major and what sort of work environment i wanted to be a part of each day was a challenge that i looked forward to tackling with my team the patience and professionalism that i was shown during the internship really gave me an example to look up to for when i work with others i learned more than just programming marketing and brand developing experience that summer i learned how to adapt to situations i learned about not being afraid to take the initiative whether that is applying to a job or showcasing an idea to a client especially with cosmetics the design and marketing of various productsnbsphas a lot of risk taking involved with each design and ad that we release to the public nbsp however the most important thing i learned was teamwork especially how to communicate despite language barriers and cultural barriers i was able to communicate with my teams efficently and accomplish all tasks thrown my waynbsp,0,0,1,1,0,psu
2220,4969,in the current day and age it is almost impossible to escape the presence of social media but there is somethingnbspmore useful and market products and businesses just as well if not better than the old forms of social meida like twitter instagram and facebook nbsp let me introduce to you the platform of youtube and twitch youtube is an online archieve of uploaded videos that can be viewed at anytime by potentially anyone twitch on the other hand is a livestreaming platform for those willing to share insight in all aspects of life from cooking to gamingnbspthrough live interactions with the content creator nbsp one of the projects that i undertook with friends and online celebrity at the time was the start of a gaming team the challenge was to build a fanbase out of nothing and hope that we get noticed from the thousands of other content creators who are also doing videos what started as a group of casual gamers with a passion to create entertainment quickly esculated into a new form of social media people asked what product we preferred for gaming and what was our opinion was in products that gave the best for gaming experiences from there we took on sponsors and advertised products that support the team to our viewers and that increased the sales of companies that were lesser known at the time into an all time high for example fans of our team would ask what headphones we used for gaming andnbspthrough a sponsorship with razer we all used razer headphones and recommended that to our fans from our personal experience the sales result spiked from just causual content creator like us and all the sponsored company did was send us free headphones to try out nbsp another example of this was during my internship with grubhub as brand ambassador i was given a code to share that would give specific discounts to those that used the code when checking out with their order i was streaming with a friend on twitch at the time and i casually mentioned the code and talked a bit about the company the next day my boss told me that in the span of two hours my code was used over  times the most the company has ever seen in such a short amount of time this was also only with a small amount of viewers compared to what other streams has had nbsp although my team has stopped creating videos for youtube and i have taken a backseat in twitch streaming this experience completely gave me an outofthebox way of thinking for social media advertising that most others do not think of the obstacles that i faced in building youtube and twitch following and fan base gave me the once in a life time opportunity to work with the upandcoming social media that companies havent even had a chance to tap into yet especially for small companies this cheap and efficient way of advertising through youtube and twitch steps away from the massive ad fees that others pay to facebook instagram or twitter nbsp i attached on of the videos that my team and i did when i was back in high school we have unfortunately split ways since then and will not continue the youtube channel,1,1,0,0,0,psu

2250,4941,recently i have been tested on multiple occasions on my integrity leadership and teamwork this past weekend i participated in nationals for club volleyball in st louis to give some perspective this is where the entire year of hard work and dedication is tested teams compete amongst all the top teams in the nation nationals is the last hoorah where you get to showcase your talent of a team in comparison to others the ultimate goal is to win a national championship nbsp going into the tournament i had a good feeling about the team and my current position previously i was a starter all year as well as one of two voted captains throughout the year i was able to compete with my teammates all while developing my leadership skills i felt comfortable with my ranking and was looking forward to playing at nationals nbsp moving forward it was time to vote again for the starters for nationals otherwise my first test against my conscience the voting had been done through a google survey this time where submissions are anonymous here i could have submitted multiple times voting for myself to start and nobody would know why wouldnrsquot i want to secure my starting position and play in front of my parents and all of my friends thankfully i was able to combat my inner selfishness and submit the votes properly as a result it turned out that i had actually tied with the other teammate in my position nbsp being that i am a captain i have to make a decision of how to handle the tie which i may point out has never happened previously another test of my integrity and responsibility in a captain role why not go by the previous tournaments and nominate myself to start after all i am the captain and deserve to make that decision wrong again i fought a mental battle that tested my character instead i decided to split time the first day to then be voted on again after the first day of play this way it would give us both an equal opportunity to fight for the starting position nbsp the first day is now finished and it is time for a vote both of us played well and we decide to have a team meeting to discuss our strategy moving forward at the end my teammate and i leave the room so the others could vote amongst themselves unfortunately what was best for the team wasnrsquot the best for me my teammate had won the vote and now i wonrsquot play as much moving forward here i find myself in another test of my character irsquom now questioning myself and my teammates and my past decisions a million thoughts are formulating in my head about how things could have been different as you can imagine i was not the happiest with the decision but i had to overcome it do i mope and complain and argue about the decision or do i take it with a grain of salt move forward and still try my best for the team nbsp nbsp looking back i decided to take the high road and realize that i wonrsquot always get what i want in every situation i may see things differently towards myself which may lead to a bias instead i must showcase what it truly means to be a leader a captain and a teammate reflecting on my attitude towards the decision i am very happy that i handled it the way i did i believe all of these tests of character helped me learn much more valuable lessons in life sometimes you may be in a position to make decisions that will ultimately benefit you over others but then you might ask yourself how true of a great leader you are looking ahead i hope to have more tests of my character so that i may grow personally and professionally ,0,0,0,1,0,psu

2255,4986,i would like to have an opportunity to talk about the time when i failed and how i overcame through it i had failed when i took  in last spring semester and we had a semester long group project the project was about picking any security issues of our choice and suggest a solution about it we had total of  team members including myself and one of our team member had a friend who already works in it field so he asked his friend about typical security issues in the real world due to his friendrsquos referral we chose a topic of complicated encryption and decryption messaging system in the company and suggested a solution of providing a nontechnical way to encrypt and decrypt the message so that way it can be easily used by any employees including people who donrsquot have technical knowledge for the first two months we did not have any problem but when we had to work on the main part which was a draft that had to be  pages everyone started to not to participate actively some group members made an excuse some of them were sick and started to postpone group project hoping someone to do the project instead i realized that this will bring up more serious problem as the project gets deeper so i stood up to change our group ambience i took the role of a group leader setting up weekly meeting and encouraged people to participate on the project the most important thing was that i assigned role to each group members as i started to work hard for the group project surprisingly every group members started to follow my direction i think the changing point was when i gave roles to each members after assigning each roles to members they started to do their part and i realized that assigning roles give them responsibilities and they also realized that this role is only assigned to them so that no one will do their part instead that was the turning point of our group and we successfully finished our project with decent grade throughout this experience i learned leadership responsibility and how to cooperate with team members,0,1,0,1,1,psu

2259,4927,during the summer of  i had the opportunity to work for mgs inc a manufacturing company in mynbsphometown of denver pa that specializes primarily in trailer production but also assume responsibility in handling several military contracting projects over my time spent working there i had the opportunity to experience the flow of company operations between departments and the many interactions that occurred to make the business run smoothly on a daily basis my role at mgs was officially documented as a processing clerk making me responsible for performing audits on past and current purchase orders and invoices however i also had the privilege of working with their technology department with their information systems expert in handling various technical company issuesnbsp as a result of this experience i feel that i gained a much better understanding of not only how business works but also gained the ability to conceptualize many inefficiencies of company processes and creatively think about solutions that i could initiate on my own nbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp one of my main responsibilities as an employee was to manage the inventories sheets on a monthly basis for both paint and metal products this task consisted of downloading the updated inventory data from their respective databases and then formatting the structure and appearance of the data into legible inventory sheets within microsoft excel this was the first task that was explained to me following my start at the company and was immediately confused as to why they completed the process with their current methods i exercised my creative thinking skills in order to make this process not only easier on myself but also more efficient for the company moving forward when irsquom no longer working with them to do this i created two macros in microsoft excel one to handle the format and printing of the metal inventory and the other for paint when my managers were exposed to what i had done by automating this process they were ecstatic i estimate that my work in creating these macros and saving them to the companyrsquos shared network for use in the future will save their next processing clerk time and energy in completing this task by reducing roughly three hours of preparatory time per month nbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp another area of inefficiency that was evident to me was the high volume of technical questions that employees frequently inquired about i quickly observed that on a daily basis the majority of questions that were asked about a technology complications were either asked before or were questions that frequently occurred throughout that specific department it was for this reason that i took the initiative to exercise my creative thinking nbspskills to design eight information technology frequently asked questions sheets one for each department amp a master copy these documents outlined descriptions of the most common technical problems for that departments as well as stepbystep instructions to try in an attempt to quickly mitigate the issue i chose to divide the sheets into departmentspecific faqrsquos

as other problems occurring both in and outside of the workplace i utilized these conversational experiences to actively listen to their feelings and problems without interjecting my opinion in an attempt to defuse controversy and mitigate any further workplace complications i feel that this has helped me to build a more professional persona for myself and also improved my ability to patiently

2339,4970,through the escape room exercise there are a number of lessons to be learned one thing that was made clear from this experience was how team work naturally emerges and different people may take lead at different times as a lead while we are inside the launchbox i wanted to take this as an opportunity to see who would take the lead naturally in a different setting and whos skills would be most valuable for solving the puzzle personally i was pleased with the outcome because different people contributed and led throughout the experience this was also a good opportunity for me to take a step back and observe with the goal of ultimately learning how my peers who are better are creative problem solving went about solving the puzzle i think the experience brought commoraderee to the group as well as possibly encouraged others to take charge and voice their ideas ,1,1,1,0,1,psu
2340,4967,you can now thank me for saving the world last week i went out to an escape room with my fellow interns this was my first time and i didnt know what to expect before we went in i wasnt sure what role i would take and how my teammates would react it wasnt as organized as i thought and our game plan was to dig right inone of the group members had experience in his hometown with escape rooms so he was giving us pointers as we went on i found it helpful to speak up when you have a clue or hunch but not lose yourself in the little things i learned to value each othersinput big or small and speak for others to hear you but dont speak to hear yourself overall we accomplished the mission and saved the world,1,0,0,1,0,psu
2341,4977,i think that this escape room activity helped me to be more engaged in a bigger group i had few people in my group that i have never talked to but this helped me to talk to them and get to know them better i donrsquot really like speaking up in a group setting but with this casual setting it helped me to speak up more and give my ideas to the group i think escape room is a good idea to bring us closer because we are all trying to reach the same goal in a limited amount of timenbsp although i had fun i wish the groups were smaller so everyone can be engaged at all times the room felt small and it was hard for me to pay attention to what everyone was saying because people will talk at the same time and everyone tried to do different things at oncenbsp,1,0,0,0,1,psu

2344,4980,i really enjoyed our trip to the escape room last friday and not only was it fun but i felt like i learned some new techniques in how to work as a team nbspour particular escape room involved stealing the mona lisa from the louvre and than replacing it with a copy nbspone of the biggest things i found to be helpful in completing the escape room was to find out what skills certain team members had and then delegate tasks to those individuals who had skills that could be useful in order to complete it nbspso for example if a member of our team was good with riddles then we would give him or her tasks that involved solving riddles another important thing i learned was that its important to put your ego aside when working in a team nbspwhat i mean by that is if you have an idea that gets shut down dont let that cause you to get upset with your team members because they didnt particularly agree with your ideanbspoverall i thought the escape room was a fun learning experience,1,1,1,1,0,psu
2345,4971,last friday it was my and most of the teammatesrsquo first time experiencing the escape room despite being short of experience we were able to complete tasks successfully in fairly short amount of time to effectively accomplish the tasks there were many skills that the team had to put however the most important skill out of all skills i believe was the determination the team was not afraid to ask help from kelly even if we knew that our points will be deducted we figured out quickly when we were not able to move on without help the team was very determinant of the teamrsquos current situation i think this is the biggest factor that lead to success of the group,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2346,4988,immediately after walking into the situation we were put in the first thing i gained from this experience was problemsolving and critical thinking based on the clues we were given it was important to work as a team and use our collective problemsolving skills to figure out what each clue meant from there we pulled together all of our experiences and thought processes to solve each clue one thing i noticed was that some people in the group werent able to process clues as fast myself included making it harder for us to solve the tasks at hand in that regard i think its important for whoever was leading the group to realize that some members needed more time to think because we went with such a large group some members might not have felt as included in the problemsolvingnbsp,0,1,1,0,1,psu

2609,4999,when people think of technology and the people that fill those jobs they more than likely picture a man in that job position men make up approximately threefourths of people in the technology field due to this stereotype that only men work in stem fields this has driven females away from any related careersnbsp nbsp i was given an amazing opportunity to attend a convention based on celebrating women in stemrelatednbspfields this conference was called the grace hopper celebration and was held in orlando fl last year there were  women who attended in  from all over the world to celebrate grace hopper and women in technology being able to attend this experience was such an empowering experience that i will value for the rest of my lifenbsp nbsp while at this conference they had a huge career fair the career fair had over one hundred companies attending to recruit women in technology this included many companies from all over america and beyond but primarily focuses on the bay area having been to a smaller career fair before here at penn state i was already intimidated i had no idea what to expect when i went but when i got there i was comfortable it was the first time being at a career fair where i had fun and felt relaxed when i go to the career fairs around state college i get anxious and uncomfortable i think a majority of that came from my selfesteem as i always assumed oh hey these students are probably more skilled than me ill go to another booth which wasnt true at all i sold myself short before even talking to a recruiter and ended up going to one booth another reason i think i felt more comfortable at the grace hopper celebrations career fair was i am a small  woman who cant see well in crowds when i go to penn states career fair i get buriednbspin the traffic of tall men in business suits i believe i got less stressed out with a crowd similar to me than with the crazed students trying to talk to their favorite companies before class nbsp not only did they have the career fair but they had engaging and interesting workshops on all the emerging technology along with emerging technology workshops they also had workshops explaining to women how to succeed in this field lastly at our opening ceremonies and closing ceremonies we had influential women in the technology realm inspire us with their stories such as melinda gates and the ceo of goldieblox debbie sterling one key point i took sterlings speech was it was okay to fail she was constantly told girls would not be interested in stemrelatednbsptoys therefore she should quit her idea and dream she never gave up and launched one of the first femaleoriented stem toys nbsp all in all i believe the grace hopper celebration was such a beneficial experience for me i would give anything to go again this year but as it approaches i know that is becoming less of a reality i believe this conference is the key to shrinking the massive gender in technology by allowing women to earn the confidence they need in stem fieldsnbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2610,4999,in every persons life we must make decisions more times than not we hope to make the correctright decisions while working as a manager in my one job i had to make a lot of decisions and solve problems to determine how to future of my stand would turn out the stand i was the manager was only in its first and second year of operation due to its short time being opened i had to solve tons of issues and potential problems before they become problems out where the guests walk in the establishment the company decided on these beautiful marble floors the bad part was we are located in a waterpark where people track water everywhere i immediately noticed this was going to be an issue one night mopping before the water park was even open i went straight to my supervisors and told them the risks of not having mats out front and how dangerous this could be although they agreed the vp of the park did not want to cover up the expensive and beautiful marble floor i went to my supervisors almost weekly on this issue with just a response that cared but didnt seem convincing that i would get mats their solution was to put wet floor signs out front and so thats what i did for the time being fast forward about a year later of me asking a little girl came in with her mother they were ordering their food and then all of a sudden the girl slips falls and whacks her head off the stainless steel table out front immediately i stopped what i was doing and ran out to check if she was okay i proceeded to tell her mother that if anything doesnt seem right to go to the first aid stations around the park after i helped the family i immediately called the vp of the park i told him what happened and how it could have been avoided had we covered some of the floors with the mats i have been begging for a couple of days after this event i receivednbspthe mats we desperately needed needless to say this is one of the few events i have regretted over the six years i worked there although i knew the correct decision to prevent this from happening i felt i should have pushed harder to have avoided it what i expected to happennbsp,0,1,0,0,1,psu

2629,4999,for a team bonding exercise all the surge interns were told to meet at a local escape room the catch was we had no idea where wenbspwere headed we were just given directions and told to meet there after arriving and finding out what we were going to be doing we split into two groups my group was to pull off a heist to steal the mona lisa my team and i had to go through four different rooms solving clues given to us and make our way to the final room throughout these rooms my team and i were constantly solving clues and brainstorming as to what the riddles might have meant while working as a team we were able to adapt to the vastly different rooms presented to us in the end we successfully completed our heist with only six seconds left in the game it was a fun and excellent team bonding exercisenbsp,1,0,1,1,0,psu
2630,4995,i had an opportunity to do some team building activity with my cointerns we had no idea about where we were going until the last minute we were given an address and was instructed to be there at a particular time and it turned out to be an escape room i always wanted to do it but never got a chance to it was a perfect activity for me to get to know more about my teammates and how they respond under pressure our task was to steal a mona lisa painting to find that painting we had to find the clues and figure out the solution to enter the final room i think our team did a very good job at making sure everyone were on same page and that everyones opinions mattered i was the communicator for the team so i had to ask for hints if we could not figure out a clue two of my teammates were given torch to help us navigate and three of them were working on finding and reading the clues it was a very unique and interesting experience for me because it is not all about figuring out the clues and winning it was about working together and believing in others i felt like this activity gave me an idea about who prefers taking the lead and who prefers following the lead after the escape room activity we did axe throwing which was another thing i have never tried in my life it was such a stress relieving activity during my first round of throwing axes i did get a single point and i was kind of getting upset but as we kept going i telling myself to think about trying my best and not winning the more i tried the more i was able to hit the target i loved both the activities and working with my teammates,1,1,0,1,0,psu

2633,4998,i thought moving across the country from my parents and living in a dorm was a stretch try doing that but living in a townhouse meant for three with one other person it is very overwhelming and the upkeep is insane it also doesnt help how all my friends come over and decide that they want to trash the place and add to the mess figuring out how to cook dinner every night go grocery shopping clean and budget money is a balancing act the problem solving skills that i use to adjust to my new living arrangement is to be patient adapt and think things out logically for example when i am grocery shopping i cant just buy everything in sight because i am a broke i make a list of things i need and only get whats on that having my own townhouse has forced me to have more responsibility for myself and to actually be an adult yes cleaning all the time isnt my favorite and it sucks to not have a meal plan but its helping me grow as a person i am excited to see where this year takes me and what new challenges will arisenbsp,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2639,5006,as a college student you always hear about career fairs every semester students dress up print out resumes and practice their elevator pitches in hopes that they would land a spot at a company that they want to work for you may wonder whether career fairs are worth attending i believe that career fairs are not necessary to go to but attending can give you a boost in the job searching process going to career fairs can open many opportunities for those who attend the main thing that you will get out of career fairs is networking networking is essential to finding a job because building a connection matters to companies a recruiter would hire a someone who has built a rapport with them over someone who just applied online another benefit is that you can practice talking to people build your confidence and possibly learn some things about a company that you wouldnt have from looking at their website the more you attend these events the more comfortable you will get so that you can market yourself to recruiters without being nervous i can agree with that because of my first career fair i was very nervous and did not know how to talk to recruiters i learned from that experience because i found out that you should research companies beforehand and what you should say to make yourself more likable and competent as a person and their future employee i was also less nervous the second time attending because ive already done it before so i knew what to expect and what i should do to increase my chances of getting a job attending career fairs can take up a lot of time because youre talking to a lot of companies and the lines are long although they take time it is not a waste because youre using that time networking and marketing yourself to companies so to answer the question career fairs are not dead because they are like a hand that can help you reach your goal,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2640,4992,i have mixed feelings about the career fair it seems like some companies are trying to interview you right away and others are just there to inform you which seems like a waste of my time because i can just look online for more information i have gotten a couple of interviews with companies at the fair so it does work i personally donrsquot think career fairs are dead but the career fair can definitely be improved career fairs can be an awesome and informative experience for ist students that can end up getting a student an internship or even a full time job the biggest problem i see is how ldquoformalrdquo the events are typically a student who is involved with technology are introverted and shy so lots of students become extremely nervous having to talk to recruiters the career fair should try to help the student become more comfortable during the event for instance the career fair requires all students to dress up in suits which will make most students uncomfortable nbspallowing students to dress more casual such as in jeans and a buttoned up shirt would allow students to be more comfortable in this scary environmentnbsp,0,1,0,0,0,psu
2641,4939,i think career fairs arenbspobsolete for a few reasons first of all a lot of employersnbspjust hand you some pamphlets which contain information about how to apply online  and if you have questions you might get some vague answers followed by a  min long overexcited monologue that went off of the topic after a few minutes not fun second of all some employers use terrible recruiters its like they arent even trying a certain company i talked to at the pro expo was specialized in cyber security but did its two recruiters reflect that fact the first recruiter was a general staff who just made you sign in using an ipad scanned your resume to upload to their system and handed you the pamphlets the other recruiter was a software developer who knew virtually nothing about cyber security andnbspwas sweating his life away when being presented with cybersecurityrelated questions so whats the point the third reason is thatnbspits a pain to try to find outnbspthe companies locations and available positions at the career fair an internet search is much faster more tailored and more accuratenbspa final note is if you want to make some meaningful personal connections some effective online hunting and a good email will be much more promisingnbsp so yes i do think career fairs are dead as dead as they could benbsp nbspnbsp,1,0,0,0,0,psu
2642,5003,are career fairs dead yes and no expos like the ones this past week can be a great too to get to know recruiters one on one they are great to establish a relationship over the years and to hopefully get an offer for a jobinternship however they can be a waste of time as well the thing i have notived of over the last few years is that they tend to be very very bust companies like ibm pwc kpmg all had lines at least  people deep i feel like even talking to an advisor at one of these comanies would be a waste of time unless you have a top notch gpa and previous experience they are looking for the best of the best and you are just one person among hundreds more however they are good experience to prepare for talking with a recruiter i tend to focus on smallerless popular companies at the career fair when i prepare for who i am going to talk to in conclusion i do think they are getting way to over crowded but they can be beneficial to establish relationships with career recruiters ,0,0,1,0,1,psu

2645,5002,today i ventured to the penn state career day at the bryce jordan center while i was excited to talk with all of the amazing companies it was also extremely intimidating penn state provides a plethora of opportunities for its students which is one of the many reasons i chose to go here one of the downsides of a big school like penn state is the amount of competition the amount of students at the career fair was in the thousands waiting in line to speak with recruiters surrounded by tons of students made it hard to prepare i felt that i made good impressions with some recruiters but it was still hard to stand out amongst so many talented students the most important way to combat this is to find what makes you unique it may not even be something you realize makes you unique but finding any type of conversation point is key when making first impressions keeping the person engaged and interested in what yoursquore talking about can help them to remember you later i always try to make sure the person irsquom speaking with is interested before i move on to another company most importantly it is important to feel relaxed when talking to recruiters being nervous can come off as not being confident this is why i always try to take a deep breathe and clear my mind before a big conversation these small things can add up to making a big difference when trying to start your career ,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2647,5001,career fairs are certainly not dead but they can be improved in various ways career faris offer an opportunity for a student to meet companies talk to recruiters and see what they look for in potential employees you can interact with recruiters face to face and build a relationship with them i believe that a face to face conversation leaves a lasting impression which is better than just accolades and skills on a resume being only a sophomore i was very limited at career fairs a lot of companies are looking for upperclassmen juniors and seniors for internship and full time positionsnbsp however i got some vaulable information that will help me further down the line penn state is such a big school which is a pro and a con a lot of big companies are present at these career fairs although its a great opportunity to talk to them there is usually a long line to talk to them and they will most likely refer you to a pamphlet or their website for information regarding possible opportunities there are so many students at penn state that are all competing for the same position which makes gaining a position even harder overall career fairs are not dead they offer benefits but should be slightly adjusted to offer students the best chance to gain an internship or full time position,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2648,5000,rafay ahmad   internship reflection career fairs are worth your time and experience  after attending the fall pro expo career day i was amazed to approach the countless number of companies presented in our university the career fair is basically an event that gives students and employers the chance to establish conversation and interact further to explore future internship and job opportunities i felt that it was worth my time since i received the chance to talk to employers about my resume and career goals to the internships i was interested in relation to my field the fair gave me essentially a knowhow and awareness about my job searches related to my career regarding summer internships to take advantage of and full time job opportunities when i graduate there are so many people of different backgrounds and college majors around you that can help assist with any question or feedback of either doing something this to better your cvresume or improve in such a matter course major participation of clubsactivities that can make you lead to a stronger candidate for the job wearing business attire served me well as itdidindicate a smart and professionalimpressionto employerscompaniesshowing i was interested for potential employment for their specific company and simply created a positive image and remark to move further i received a lot of internship flyers and contact cards from employers which motivated me to apply home quickly and start the application process as i knew many of these companies were competitive in terms of finding strong pool of candidates the career fair basically provided me more information about the different companies out there in todays job market and assisted me to further contact those companies for possible internships for me in the summer to participate throughout my undergraduate school years anyone who is a student looking for internship opportunities or graduates should definitely take advantage of these fairs they can provide you with a bunch of information about companies you are unfamiliar or have not heard about before till then i wish the best for me as i apply to companies for my next summer internships,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2649,4999,this past week i was sitting in class overhearing a conversation that a couple of my group members were having they were talking about career fairs and they were mentioning how career fairs are a huge conspiracy and that they all tell you to apply online this bummed me out although i do agree that when i go to career fairs and they ask me to apply online it gets pretty frustrating i however disagreed that they are this huge conspiracy theory there is so much to gain from a career fair that i would definitely recommend taking the time to go i have only attended a few career fairs but attending these career fairs helped me escape from my bubble i trapped myself in ive gone to the ist career fair at the westgate building and the nittany lion inn and i have also gone to the grace hopper celebration career fair when i attended my first career fair i was nervous and doubted myself and my abilities this inevitably stopped me from putting myself out there to all these companies and only talking to one company the next career fair i went to was the grace hopper one and i was able to fully stretch outside of my comfort zone and meet some of my favorite companies although most companies tell you to apply online it is true when they tell you if you give a resume at a career fair and then apply online it does help push you ahead of other applicants if they liked you i experienced this first hand when i recruited for erie insurance my last summer internship this recently passed career fair i was able to learn that career fairs are not hoaxes and i believe they will always help the future of the job seeker career fairs in my opinion will never be a thing of the pastwe may adapt how we conduct it but they will always be importantnbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2653,4994, i believe that traveling is good for the soul it opens your eyes to different cultures traditions and how people live their daily life australia is half way across the world and is fourteen hours ahead of us in pennsylvania basically when we are just getting up at  am to start our day they are winding down at  pm its a very weird concept to me that we live in a world where it is night in some areas and day time in other areas it is important to view other cultures because culture is a way of peoples everyday lives that influences their views values beliefs everyone needs to learn to have an appreciation for other cultures because it helps us understand the way other people think when you are thrown into a room full of people with different cultures you are starting with nothing but as you learn to get to know people you learn about their life and the reason for being who they are the beautiful thing about traveling is you can start with no knowledge of anything but come back with an appreciation and so much knowledge about people you never thought you would meet before               normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      wlsdexception l,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2675,4998,this entry topic is near and dear to my heart because i consider being caring and genuine a key component of who i am kindess is a quality that i find very underrated its so easy to be mean ignoring someone is simple but going out of your way to compliment someones outfit takes guts i feel like most people now a days are mean because they say life has hardened them and theyre that way by circumstance i think thats a cop out people are afraid to be vulnerable and say how they really feel because rejection sucks we are so scared of being judged and ridiculed that we bottle everything up and pretend that were invincible thats probably why i am so nice to be the substitute for those who arent there are many countless time where i have been kind i have bought my friends food when they didnt have money on the and opened doors for strangers simple things that really mean so much one instance actually occured recently my friend didnt get into this program that she desperately wantednbsp to get into she texted me saying how she was crying so i immediately call her she sobs and says how she worked so hard and they just didnt want her we talk for a few hours while i console her and tell her how if it was meant to be she would have happened there is something great in store for you and that everything will work out she continues to vent and when shes done thanks me for calling her the next day i text her saying that we are going out to lunch we get food and i take her shopping as well to get her mind off the whole thing we had a full girls day where we just had fun before i left to go home she hugged me and said youre such a great friend and that today meant alot to her knowing how emotional and sappy i get i almost cried what most of my friends dont know is that seeing them content warms my heart especially in college your friends are your second family theyre the ones there for you to look after you and make sure youre ok this is why they mean so much to me because they have been there for me just as much as i have been there for them for my attatchment i included a picture of my friends and i which i think seems fitting a quote that resonates with me is wherever there is a human being there is an oppurtunity to be kind kindness happens at any moment on any day and you dont need a reason to extend it imagine how better off the world would be if one person did one nice act for someone else and them for someone else and then it kept going,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2738,5009,every people eventually faces a stressful challenge in their life when they are working on longterm projects or school assignments decide whether to pivot or to persevere to maximize the efficiency of certain plans people have to decide whether they stick to the plan or pivot the entire plan i know that this topic is really debatable i believe that it is important to whether pivot or preserve depends on the situation for example i took  last semester my first professor was honestly terrible at teaching i did not understand what she was saying in the class and she did not care about his student at all i usually try to persevere on my plan in most of the situation but i felt that if i take  with her i will definitely fail the class i dropped that class in dropadd period and take the class with different professor the class was much better and i got a in that class according to my experience i have been through many situations that i have to persevere or pivot my advice is to figure out anticipated results of each decision ,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2739,4993,zappos work culture is something is truly inspiring when looking for future jobs i only hope to like my job the company i work for and my coworkers as much as the individuals working for zappos when zappos was not doing well financially the employees stuck by their company regardless of the lack of money they were receiving the employees truly enjoyed their job so much and showed their company that when it was most important by truly enjoying what you do and the work you are doing can only then make you truly successful the second aspect that stood out to me was their care for their clients they care more for their clients than their competitors which is why they are able to stand out and are able to have such loyal customers the third is the experience tony hsiegh has been through that allows him to run the company with such success he previously worked for a company that he did not like the values and culture that the company had become this experience allowed him to create a better work culture and experience for his employees that revolves around care and friendship nbsp                  normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2741,5000,sometimes in life i tend to fail whether it is not passing an exam or scoring poorly on a class assignment that is just my misfortune and bad luck on that day which i just have to accept moving on to persevere and persisting to strive harder towards my goals in order to be more successful receiving a failing grade does hurt by losing confidence and does carry an unwelcoming impact towards other classes including the overall academic performance there have been times where i have received a grade that was not scored properly to the scoring scale expectations that should have been positively anticipated or expected following these resultsnbspthis caused me to develop an effective change to cope up those past mistakes and make a sincere effort of changing my strategynbspin my work ethics leading tonbspbetter and finer quality of results in my classes nbsp my perserverance came first from my intention that i want to keep my aims high for a brighter future and that comes with passing and acquiring good grades from my classes having that intention is regarded primary first and foremost after that i knew that my strategy for my work ethic had to change i was taking the exams without any preparation during one of my semesters in college during the beginning stages and did not have a clue of how i was answering such a question meaning there was no prior background knowledge coming from me that i could have performed accurately well on that exam that was a disservice that i created for myself and i knew studying beforehand was necessary which ultimately served me well when taking the other examinations for my classes having a prior knowhow and prior revision was necessary for exam material in order to pass even just reading for    gave me a significant boost to perform reasonably well on the exam although i did study more days in advance before the exam i was able to sometimes even ace it as well and score  too i persevered by putting in a bit more effort and energy mentally to read the powerpoints and notes for the topics covered in class look at videos which could serve as a visual aid in terms of thinking about concepts and look at practice questions online in the internet that could help me understand before taking the actual exam all three of these studying strategiestactics were meaningful that provided me the benefit to pass my examsclasses and actually learn these studying approaches to implement towards my next semester college classes it is true with hard work intention and the motivation to succeed pays off taking any exam without preparing for it has unlikely results of such a person not passingscoring up to the standard as well with any exam i learned it is better to prepare and study the concepts as needed for as much time before it in order to do well and be satisfied nbsp nbsp there are some times where i did struggle by not understanding the concepts for the exam and me just working independently and trying to figure out what to do alone in terms of studying did not work out as accurately and efficiently as i wanted i had to give up this selfindependent studying strategy and i had to pivot in terms of turning around to find directions of a new solution which meant i had to seek help from my professors colleagues of asking if there was any private tutoring that can overcome my deficiencies and help me understand the course material in an effective way after seeking some help i was given a tutor list i selected a tutor during my freshman year of college who i thought was meeting my needs after reviewing the tutors background and education profile and ultimately that tutornbspbecame highly useful in the sense that i still ask for questions and help when needed even now in my sophomore year of college the benefits of tutoring rather studying independently was that i kept getting help instantly to understand a concept in less time rather than me taking long chunks of time figuring out the solutionconcept by myself help is useful for anyone and it is important to not be shy or timid because in life there are going to be times where you might need some adviceassistance from others that can help you be successful this was my problem in the beginning that i realized first that i could do everything on my own but coming to know that i could not and needed help to understand concepts from a tutor also seeking help coming from my colleagues and professors was beneficial as well tutoring gave me that extra boost to pivot my usual studying tactics to seek help from someone who has a higher understanding than me that extra boost for tutoring gave me confidence repetition of concepts to be memorized and well understood andnbspbetter studying preparation resources offered from the tutoring sessions to assist with my currentupcoming preparations for my upcoming exams nbsp nbsp regarding myself i prefer to both persevere and pivot either way if things do not work out for me i strive harder to persevere using my resources that i have and try to organize myself effectively to accomplish my goals if i pivot i am taking alternate strategies that could be beneficial in terms of seeking help or using other resources that can make me as successful as possible perseverance and pivot basically mean the same ideatopic to me but in different instancesperspectives and that

2744,4994,tony hsieh from zappos emphasized that a peopleoriented culture makes zappos unique and successful he had mentioned how in the past at his previous job link exchange that the culture had gone downhill and it was not a fun place to work anymore this was a strange feeling for him because he had cofounded the company and ended up losing control of the culture he wanted to make sure that zappos did not end up like link exchange and that zappos culture would get stronger as they grew some aspects of the video that stood out to me was that tony read good to great and tribal leadership which are two books that researched and looked at what separated the great companies in terms of longterm financial performance from just the good companies one of the key ingredients the book tribal leadership found in great companies but not in good companies was strong cultures hearing this zappos decided to formalize the definition of their culture into ten core values tony wanted to make sure that these values did not sound lofty like a press release or something that their marketing department put together he wanted zappos to be committed to these values and by committed he means hiring and firing people based on whether they are living up to the core values independent of their job performance another interesting aspect of the video was that zappos spent a lot of money on marketing in the beginning and that almost drove them out of business this ultimately forced zappos to focus on customer service the second ingredient tribal leadership found in great companies but not in good companies in terms of longterm financial performance was that great companies had a vision and a higher purpose beyond money profits or being number one in a market from my perspective hearing how important company culture was to zappos made me realize what type of work environment i want to work in when i graduate from college i value the same type of values which emphasize a fun working environment where you genuinely want to go to work instead of valuing superficial values such as money               normal                  false   false   false      enus   xnone   xnone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         wlsdexception lockedfalse  namegrid tabl,0,1,0,1,0,psu

2747,4998,i feel like choosing the words perserve and pivot are very subtle pivot doesnt really have the negative connotation that i think it should thats why i edited it to fight or flight becuase if you want a deep response we have to have more subjective words to me flighting or pivoting is taking the easy way out choosing to refute something that seems too strenuous for the most part i feel like theres nothing a person cant do yes some people have physical or even mental limitations but most things can be learned or accomplished if you care enough sticking it out and having the willpatience is what seperates those from fighting or flighting having grit and that inner strength is the deciding factor for instance i fight when it has to deal with someone or something i truly care about because to me its worth it i fight through quarrels with my family tensions with friends and anything related to me growing into the person i want to be i flight when something is a waste of time or has no meaning or impact this pertains too unecessary work fake people and negative energy sometimes im at a crossroads because i flight when i should fight and vice versa i have fought for already broken relationships where holding on has done more harm then good i have run away from things that i shouldnt have because i was too afraid of falling i have done nothing in circumstances where i dont know how to feel or what my next move is we all get stuck making mistakes that most people confuse with regret i used to regret everything in my life that i wish didnt happen this just made me feel so empty and not in control in my free time i sometimes look up inspirational quotes because who doesnt need a pick me up from time to time i like to think this makes me a little wiser than most lol so i will leave you with this last thing live life with no regrets because at one point that was something you really wanted when you really think about it every little action or encounter that you wish didnt happen at one point you really wanted it too if you regret letting go of a friend or kissing someone you shouldnt have dont at one point it did feel good to shed that toxic person or finally make a move all you can do is learn from these moments because thats what makes memories and great stories to tellnbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2748,4939,in life im faced with the decision of choosing between perseverance and pivoting very often a famous quote is winners never quit and quitters never win but i believe sometimes itshealthier to let go of unrealistic goals perseverance is different from stubborness as perseverance is for achieving goals and stubborness gets you stuck in a situation and without good reasons i choose to persevere when im trying to become good at something that i genuinely care about or when im trying to make a change that i believe to be necessary as for pivoting i do it when ican no longer keep trying whether it be from mental emotional or physical exhaustion however im careful about choosing goals so i dont unnecessarily quit halfway and feel frustrated about it also to avoid wasting time and energy because they could be used for something else,0,1,1,0,0,psu

that one of my colleaguesnbspwas asking of me this was an easy dilemma to solve and i instantly knew that cheating was wrong and it devalued the work of honesty and academic integrity at a

disservice and not learningacquiring anything out if by continuing to cheat for a class subject that you may not be as proficient with and advising him most importantly to think through the negative consequences of cheating and how that can impact your grades or lead to problemstrouble for your college career my friend instantly began to realize and corrected his behavior he suddenly wanted to

him out prior to the days before the exam to help him understand the material to perform well i gave some one on one tutoring reinforced the fundamentals of calculus gave practice problems and showed youtube videos as a visual to help him grasp the material ultimately those studying materials youtube calculus videosnbspand guidance paid off my friend was able to show confidence of how to solve calculus equations computationally conceptually from word problems and draw graphs representing a calculus equation i was proud of him and really impressed with the dedication he gave of studying

day he scored above average andnbspearned an a grade for the exam that shows that his hard work and intention made it happen he had a true vision and instantly came to realize that he learned something passing the exam with his own work and changed his strategy of completing things to do in an easy waynbspby just studying for his exam from that day he learned that it was important to study for exams in advance to do well by not just finding the easy shortcut and cheat to put yourself at a disservice i was proud of my friends alteration and change in the process and was glad to see him

2763,5000,i have been volunteering for many organization clubs and extracurricular events ever since i was in highschool but my favoriteone came down to volunteering at mount medical center this past weekend i got a chance to volunteer at our local hospital located about  away from penn state serving as a patient floor volunteer i volunteered on saturday devoting three hours providing any help that i could do for the hospital staff the experience was sensational helping out multiple patients in their times of need whether it was doing discharges back to back assisting nurses and doctors with any medical equipment delivering medications from the hospital pharmacy to other paramedical staff and rotating around my assigned floor for any services needed the three hour volunteering session was a good time pass as i was occupied with many tasks to fulfill help out and overall gave me experience working in a clinicalbasedhealthcare setting as i was volunteering i got to interact with some other volunteers and also explore career opportunities by observing doctors and nurses performing at their day to day job many of the volunteers who volunteer here daily go on to pursue medicine as they become fascinated by the environment they work in for me i just wanted to help volunteer at the hospital for a good cause i like helping people and the smile i get from patients at the hospital really makes me feel good about myself ensuring that i am making a valuable impact towards the state college community doing little errands of delivering flowers or sending get well soon cards to the patients room is always a delight seeing the patient compliment you on your behalf of the effort to send those things up which makes me smile and feel good about myself in all volunteering makes you feel good about the things you do for others provides you a sense of pride and satisfaction and an honor of respect coming to you from others at the hospital i was able to get one free lunch that was provided to all the volunteers for their hard work each time a volunteer came to volunteer at the hospital maybe one day again i will volunteer again at another hospital organization universityschool for another good cause and benefit,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2764,5008,i think what makes the zappos culture so unique is that the company is not focused solely on making a profit they are extremely dedicated to providing a service and ensuring the happiness and fulfillment of all of their employees and customers one of the things i found most interesting about the company is that they offer tours and seminars to the general public and other companies with the purpose of assisting them in devloping their own company culture and values i have never heard of a company going out of their way to assist others that may end up being their competition one day another thing i found interesting is the companys willingness to let employees go based on their own values and how they are integrating with the company culture and that an employee could be let go based on these factors and not their actual job performance i was pretty pleased with the results of my strengths test i scored highest in areas involving emotional intelligence criticial thinking and teamwork my lower scores involved leadership priority setting and risk taking,0,0,0,1,0,psu
2765,5008,i think one of the hardest decisions a person can make is when to give up or perservere with something and a lot of factors go into it it has always been hard for me to move on from something that i really want or want to accomplish in my personal experience i have only moved on from something when the effort going into it was not equal to or exceeded the outcome i wanted or was going to get at a certain point if i have been trying to accomplish something for a very long time and was making little to no progress i feel it would be in my best interest to focus my attention on something more attainable everybody is different and every circumstance is different but i truly believe that if something just isnt working out you owe it to yourself to keep moving forward,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2766,5008,i have not had enough experience in a workplace to have experienced an ethical dilemma in that setting and honestly it was hard of me to think of one i have had to write about the closest thing to an ethical dilemma i have had was about two years ago my family and i had just adopted a new dog a german shepherd husky mix it was pretty obvious as soon as we brought her home that it wasnt a good fit we also had a cat and the new dog kept trying to attack the cat i knew that it wasnt going to work out but i felt horrible about taking her back to a shelter so i kept insisting she stay it wasnt until she broke off of her chain and attacked a deer that i realized it was in everyones best interest including hers to take her back to the shelter i felt horrible doing it but i knew that i wouldnt be able to give her the environment that she needed to have a good life and that i would just be selfish if i kept insisting on keeping her,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2772,4994,i love the concept of new years resolutions because everyone has so much ambition in the beginning of the year seeing everyone have a passion to change their life for the better makes the world an overall better place i sincerely hope that everyone sticks to their resolutions and continues to improve in any shape or form for me personally i want to change the way i eat and workout while i already eat fairly well and workout almost every day i was not seeing the exact results i wanted in  in  i need to educate myself better on what types of foods are healthier to eat than others and what types of workouts will make me gain muscle not just to lose weight some resolutions that will stay the same are always being there for my friends and family and helping them in any way they might need i love giving back and i always put their needs before mine i love seeing the smile on peoples faces once i help them out some initiatives that will be taken will to improve my mental health by going to bed early drinking lots of water and having sweets in moderation this will keep my mind and body healthy so that when i start my new workout goal i will be very energized some priorities that will be set will not going out as often and making my grades my number one priority while my grades are very good i always want and know that i can do better i strongly believe that you should never set a limit because once you reach it your mind will tell you that you are finished you are never finished and you can always set your goal higher to do better ,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2775,4998,when reading this weeks reflection topic the fact that the question talk about a time you faced an ethical dilemma is one of the trickiest interview quesitons is shocking i find it to be a fairly straightforward question everyone has to make choices everyday and choose one of two paths as simple as it sounds meerly choosing whether to hold the door open for the person behind you or let it shut abruptly in front of them is an ethical dilemma i know the dilemma that recruiters aquire are more complex than that so i am going to talk about a dilemma i face almost everyday whether to let go of the people dragging me down or hold on to them because at one point they were the ones holding me up what makes this hard is the fact that either decision is going to hurt by letting go of fake friends and negative energies it will ultimately benefit me in the long run but in the short run i will be upset over losing a friendship by holding onto someone toxic i still have my friend but they are just causing unending stress to my life the reason i hold on is that i hope that they will change but if theres one thing i have learned its that you cant change a person they have to do it on their own and genuinely want too i also dont want to feel used i have had people be friends with me because of the people i know or the clubs that i am in i have had people use me just so that their life is a little less boring i have had one person ask me to get lunch with them but because i didnt respond to their text in less than five minutes they asked someone else i guess they really didnt want to hang out with me huh if they did that person would have waited for my response instead of meerly finding anyone thats not busy so that they dont have to be alone as simple as this internal conflict sounds its really bigger than you think they say your friends are your family that you get to choose but you would never just excommunicate a family member from your life right you get through hard times and stick it out because of the bond you have but when does it get to be too much where is the point that you have to take drastic measures and just let go so talk about a time you faced an ethical dilemma well i face one every time i get that sorry you didnt answer in two seconds so i am going with someone else textnbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2825,5006,a time when i took a big risk is deciding to go to college not knowing what i actually want to do i believe that is a big risk to take because the thought of studying something for years and deciding that you actually dont want to do that for the rest of your life is very frightening although i still dont know the path that i will take for the future i think that the risk turned out well i experienced many things when i decided to go to college i talked to many people of different backgrounds and was also able to meet people that helped me get outside of my comfort zone to try new things before i came to college i was reluctant to try new things because i didnt know what things would be like but after learning to deal with discomfort i am comfortable with trying new thigns and exploring the unknown a risk that i contemplated taking but did not due to overwhelming fear does not come to mind because they probably did not have a big enough impact on me to dwell on it i think that if i were to not take a risk that would change my life for the better i would regret it and not be happy with myself it is true that to advance in life you always have to take risks so that you can get out of your comfort zone and try new things that could be beneficial in your life,1,0,1,0,0,psu
2826,5006,something new that i did alone before was trying out a new restaurant it was summer time and i had nothing to do i was craving something to eat and i remembred a brazilian restaurant that i always walked by but never ate at i decided to go out and buy some brazilian food because i never had brazilian food beforenbsp exploring new foods is a hobby of mine because i enjoy to eat and explore new flavors from different areas of the world a dream of mine is to travel the world to experience new cultures and eat the foods from that country not only do i want to eat their food but i also want to see how they are made because it fascinates me how different countries have different ingredients and ways of preparing a dish,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2827,5006,some skills that ive acquired or polished are my people skills i was able to be more comfortable with talking to people that i do not know i also experienced more teamwork time management and delegation its important that people work well together because even if youre very skilled at something the project will not work out well if you cant work well together theyve benefitted me by giving me the ability to work in any kind of team settingnbsp i was the type of intern that focused on my own tasks but i am always open to offering help whenever i complete my tasks or if the task does not take a lot of time then i can put my tasks aside to help out a collegue i contributed my ability to complete tasks efficiently and in a timely manner i was able to improve businesses through web design and marketing i definitely couldve slacked off less because sometimes i would wait until the last minute to complete something if i were a reference to myself i would say that i am diligent in my work and that i would always make sure that i complete my tasks nbsp,0,1,0,1,1,psu
2828,5006,the way that i handle this kind of situation is to ignore them because i have a high tolerance for these kind of things if it were to bother me then i would kind ask that person to not do what theyre doing if the person does not cooperate then i will just ignore them because i believe it is not worth my effort to get them to stop if they do not want to be considerate enough to stop,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2829,5001,ever since i was  i have been working part time while going to school i particularly like jobs that require very little to no human interaction whether it be entering data or stocking shelves i have always tried to minimize talking or interacting with anyone else i am somehwat antisocial i like to keep to myself however this past summer i decided to make a change and try something new i decided i needed a new challenge and i became a server at a local restaurant this is very daunting to me as this position entailed constnalty interacting with guests i wouldnt say i am the best at small talk however i went ahead and faced this challenge head on i knew that this was going to be a somehwat difficult learning process but it was going to be beneficial for me in the future my first couple of weeks as a server were rough and awkward at times i had troubles initially connecting with the guests and having a conversation with them however with more practice i soon settled in and began to open up to guests i wanted the guests to feel welcomed and comfrotable the best way to alleviate those worries was to just imagine i was having a conversation with my friends getting out of your comfort zone is daunting trying something new and out of the ordinary is off at first however you learn a lot about yourself you have to adapt and learn,0,1,1,1,0,psu

2831,5008,it may not seem like a huge deal but my biggest risk was deciding to transfer from the altoona campus to university park a lot of students at penn state go this route spending a few years at a branch campus and then moving on to the main campus at first i decided a little differently i stayed at altoona for  years instead of the  that most students choose to do truthfully i was scared of coming to university park i went to a fairly small high school where everybody knew everybody so i felt extremely comfortable with the size of the altoona campus i didnt have any desire to leave mostly because my two best friends were staying at altoona and i didnt want to be alone at university park so i stayed for another year but soon realized i wasnt getting the opportunities that i needed for my future career at altoona i eventually decided i needed to move campuses for my own betterment and that i needed to let go of the fear of leaving the friends and comfort i already had at altoona im extremely glad i chose to do this i am much happer at university park than i ever was at altoona and i have so many more opportunities for growth and advancement here than if i had decided to stay,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2832,5008,one of the things about myself that i have been trying very hard to improve on is independence i hate doing things or going places by myself and i tend to freak myself out with the thought that if i go to places like restaurants or movie theaters alone that people will think badly of me and that i have no friends when realistically i know this is far from the truth about a week ago i decided to go to the movies by myself while this doesnt seem like anything special it was nervewracking for me to do a usually social activity by myself it ended up not being nearly as bad as i thought it would be and though going places by myself definitely isnt my favorite thing to do im hoping that i can get better at learning to be content just hanging out with myself occassionallynbsp,0,0,1,0,0,psu

2842,5002,psychologist daniel goleman coined the term ldquoemotional intelligencerdquo in  the term refers to how one handles and controls their emotions this is a simple yet very effective tactic that can actually lead to increased performance in life and in the workplace in my own life i have had times where i definitely could have used emotional intelligence on one particular occasion i was very against listening to criticism while working on a project i ignored some valuable and constructive criticism that my group members were giving me if i would have listened to them i would have done better on my portion of the assignment this was definitely a time where i should have benefitted from criticism instead of ignoring it  nbsp unlike the time where i was emotionally unintelligent i have also had times where i correctly used my emotional intelligence there was a time where one of my roommates accidentally broke something of mine in the beginning i held a grudge but i began to realize that it would have led to more harm than help even though he replaced the item i was still very frustrated for a few weeksi decided to talk with him about it and i eventually learned to forgive and forget i am glad chose to use my emotional intelligence to handle the situation it definitely helped me make the right decision when dealing with a tough issue ,0,0,1,0,0,psu

2929,5028,after the first day if the internship i have a pretty good feeling that i can do what it takes to have the project done sufficiently i am excited to start on each of my given projects and also work with my team to get it done successfully after the first day communicating with different interns i feel confident with the people i am working with i can see that they have the potential in them to do work accurately and also collobrate well i am definetly going to set my standards high and think deeper on each individual project to get the best ideas possible within my team we will split up duties and responsibilities evenly so not one person has too much pressure on them overall i am very excited to get started,1,1,0,1,1,psu
2930,5025,i thought this experience was very enriching for multiple reasons first i loved being able to learn more about my peers i got to see everyone in a different light learn about their pasts their families and whats important to them i feel that it strengthend my connections with the other interns and it makes me excited to work with them more in the future additionally it helped me learn more about myself when i mentioned that i missed my family i was referring to my family in scotland i have not seen them in almost  years because of college and summers being more busy than when i was younger and i regret not being more in touch with them since then i realized that communication with them is something that i need to work on moving forwardnbsp,1,0,0,0,0,psu
2931,5023,one piece in particular stood out to me during our visit to the palmerton museum it was callednbspworking horse haulingnbspits dark earthen tones painted a portrait of a work horse hard at work hauling something just out of frame the raw power and beauty of the painting evoked emotions of reverance and solitude alone however it was the deeper meaning behind painting that resonanted with me for me it reminded me of my father this is because a horse such as this knows nothing but work it wont win ribbons or derbys it will not be entered in any shows but it will work to its full potential every day this is all it knows the beauty lies within the simplicity of a hard days work then one day after a hard days work that horse will die it wont be remembered or held on great ceremony it will just be gone leaving room for the next horse to take over only the farmer will know and appreciate the horse for what it truly was a rock a symbol of the tireless toil of the human spirit to push on throughnbspthe inevitable monotony that life can sometimes throw at you knowing that while the work may never cease you will reach peace in the end taking solace in the fact that there is still so much more to look forward too,1,0,0,1,0,psu
2932,5026,nbsp today with our tour of the palmer museum of art i came across a sculpture of two peacocks these peacocks were fighting but the piece gave me a sense of beauty rather than ugliness of agression there was a certain elegance to piece i believe that could have been drawn from the attention to detail within the art work or the fact that i recognize peacocks as a beautiful creature one i do not associate with violence the emotions i felt looking at this was a sense of joy and humor the peacocks reminded me of my trip to seville spain when i visisted the real alcaacutezar in the palace is this huge elbaorate stunning garden within the forest section of the garden there lives these three peacocks that were considered memebers of the palace my one friend who was fascinated by the birds decided to try and get close shortly after walking carefully towards the peacock the animal turned towards him and let out a loud shriek he immediately jumped back and nearly fell over i remeber laughing so hard i nearly fell over myself so when i looked at the piece it brought me back a memory of laughter although i do not belive the artist had these exact same emotions while creating the piece i think the artist felt a deal of realization when creating the sculpture that even beautiful gentle looking things are capable of fighting in gracious ways although i could create a sense of the artists emotions my emotions were certainly different as this art brought a smile to my facrenbsp,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2933,5031,i really enjoyed our visit to the palmer museum of art i find that i get in my head when i spend all day on my computer programming reading or just exploring its awesome just go somewhere and lookimagine i honestly wouldnt mind doing something like this again and i think it would be healthy for me to visit an art gallery even as frequently as once a month i also liked the activity that we did in the museum i found it interesting because it gave me perspective into how everyone views art i enjoy art by looking at the pieces and then reflecting on my emotions i dont enjoy really analyzing art too much because it is not enjoyable to me but i could tell some peers really enjoyed analyzing the art to a deeper level which is fine everyone enjoys things differently and for different reasons looking at art for me is an escape similar to going to the gym to lift everything else is out of my mind and i only focus on my form and how my body feels the world we live in now is full of distractions and really spreads me out thinnbspi am able to recenter myself by doing things like enjoying art lifting at the gym and other hobbiesactivities i have grown to enjoy,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2935,5029,the painting still life with mandolin fruit and a ceramic jug made me think about my past and how it felt to be a kid again i was reminded of my days after school and my activities and how it felt coming home to a table filled with food and snacks it made me feel happy and lucky that i always had food on the table i felt comfort in knowing that as soon as my day was done there was always something to eat i used to eat as much as i want and help myself with everything on sight nowadays i dont have that luxury anymore as a college student living on my own i dont have someone preparing the food for me or a stockpile of food ready for consumption as soon as im done with my schoolwork i actually have to prepare food myself and go to the grocery store im also reminded of how much more i used to eat back then as a kid i knew that there would always be food on the table but in college i need to limit myself as not doing so would make me run out of food quickly there was little to no worries as a kid you didnt have to worry about anything and our parents took care of all our problems its certainly different now,1,0,0,0,0,psu
2936,5016,the palmer museum of art is a treasure on campus that people often overlooked students usually walk past the building without even thinking of going in however the art pieces displayed in the museum is phenomenal every single art piece no matter is it a painting or a sculpture has its very own special story nbsp one painting reminds me of my hometown and my childhood the red metal bridge depicted in the painting is very similar to the bridge beside my grandpas house it is one of the very first bridges built in taiwan and it is helping people to get across shores of the longest river in taiwan nbsp the atmosphere in the museum is peaceful you find everything go slowly inside the gallery theres no students rushing to classes and no cars blowing by within your sight you feel like you could truly bond with the art works and look into the minds and feelings when the artists are creating them the longer you look the deeper you go into the art piece it is also interesting to hear others sharing their own stories this activity makes us know more about our coworkers background and thoughts taking a moment to dive into the sea of art works in the palmer museum of art is a great experience it allows us to take a little break in this busy and fast pace society,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2937,5028,today we visited the palmer museum of art here at penn state university one of the art pieces i liked at the museum was a painting by jerome paul watkin and it was a canvas of a person named jeff davies the emotion i noticed in this artwork was that the guy in the picture looks like he has been going through a lot it looks like he is not financially stable by the clothes he is wearing with stains when i looked at this painting and read the description i felt good about it because it says the painter paints the people that are near to his heart with great passion and after reading that i realized that it really doesnt matter how a person may look or dress because if heshe is close to your heart you would do anything to show off that person i think watkins was feeling great making this painting since he knows how this person is and especially because he is a human being very close to him he definetly was feeling great of himself while painting this piece of artnbsp,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2941,5022,today as a part of the surge development internship i had the opportunity to visit the palmer art museum on campus i was very excited to see the museum as i had gone once before for an english class my freshman year and had always wanted to go again but could never find the time as we walked through the museum and awed at the beuatiful art that was on display the guide prompted us to find a piece that invoked any memories or feelings within us a couple different pieces really stood out to menbsp the first piece was called fighting peacocks and was an incredibly detailed scuplture of as the name states two peacocks fighting the sculpture reminded me of my mom who is someone i miss a lot while at school one of her faveorite animals is the peacock and i have grown up in a house decorated with peacock feathers it was nice to see something that gives me a reminder of my childhood homenbsp another piece that invoked feelings within me was the painting called bridge on the river this picture showed a big tree with three girls standing under it the tree overlooked what seemed to be a small town and the overall background of the picture showed that it was probably a nice summer or spring day this scene reminded me of highschool right outside of my highschool there was a hill with a big tree that overlooked the surrounding town during our highschool years me and my friends would go sit under that tree after school and hangout i have many amazing memories with my friends under that tree which i cherish becuase now that we are all growing up we have gone separate ways and do not get to see each other often both of these pieces reminded me of good memories and happy timesnbsp,1,0,0,0,0,psu
2942,5021,when i saw this painting i initially thought it was just a collection of fruits later on when i made my way back to the stairs the finer details were staring right in the corner of my eye the first thing i noticed was the giant swirls in the middle of the picture because of the discoloration the swirls led me to the vast amount of portraits inside of the fruits it eventually led to details so small that i had to go up real close and squint when i saw those details it made me think of how our first glance at something can be so linear i felt as though the artist was telling me that something as simplistic as apples can camouflage our deeper thoughts shenbspdefinitely had something bothering her when she created this portrait her inner most thoughts were probably surfacing while she created this and when she went to sleep at night after looking at the painting for several minutes i felt her thoughts overwhelming her everything from the beautiful imagery of serene landscapes to the etchings of trespassed worry i really liked the artwork and wish i had more time to look at it since i noticed it towards the end of our trip,0,0,0,0,0,psu

2947,5016,setting a clear value when starting a business is essential that particular value needs to resonate with your own personal value and it could also be used to recruit people that matched the value  one interesting part of the video is when tony is describing the work environment and culture of zappos he said that all everyone is friend with one another zappos is like a second family for employees like they mentioned in the video people often talked about worklife balance but for them its more of a worklife integration this is a completely new idea to me because i have never heared someone like this i guess people really have to be super passionate with their work to reach that level of integration  i hope this kind of work culture is what i could experience at surge i think it would be similar because all interns share some similar background and are working closely together on projects beside we really had and will have lots of team bonding activities so we should get to know and understand each other fairly well this kind of integration could definitely help with our communication and efficiency when working on projects  most test results are not too suprising to me one instance would be my confidence about my honesty lying to people just does not feel right for me there is a voice inside me that maintains my integrity on the other hand self control is one of the results lower than anticipated i though id be a person that easily controls himself without exploding in front of other people but the result came out indicates me below average,0,0,0,0,0,psu
2948,5025,what makes the corporate culture of zappos unique is that it isnt just a missoin statement to look good on paper it seemed that tony was extremely serious about the culture and was willing to fire people if they strayed away from itnbspwhat stood out to me the most was tonys openness in talking about his mistakes and failures he talks about his unhappiness with the previous company he had and that surprised me a lot of people would not talk about their failures and especially not talk about when it was directly their fault additionally i was surprised at the fact that he streams his company meetings the openess and honesty that this shows of him and the company was very unique in the corporate world i was also surprised at the fact that he was so willing to help other companies by revealing the secrets of his company what surprised me more was that he didnt see this training as a business i thought that tony was overall a very different type of business person than we typically see and it made me happy to know that there are still people like that in this worldnbsp additionally for my brief skills test i got curiosity as my highest skill i really think that this skill applies to most areas of my life it makes me curious to learn in academic settings but also to learn more about other people this intrinsic motivation must be what urges me to want to work with others and learn more about them i notice this definitely helps me most in teamwork and initiative i think i work well with others because i know more about them and my curiousity makes me want to know more so therefore i actively try to learn morenbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu
2949,5018,the zappos corporate culture is successful and unique because they devote a great amount of time to making it one of their top priorities i was really impressed when tony said that when zappos employeersquos leave work they usually go hangout with other zappos employees this shows how tight knit the relationships at zappos are i think that if you are friends with someone at work you shouldnrsquot be limited to seeing them just at the office this can help a group of coworkers become closer together which could possibly improve work efficiency i was also impressed that tony was interested in creating a worm farm in order to generate profit at such a young age this shows that he always had an eye focused towards business ideas even though some of them the worm farm werenrsquot that great a quick sidenote i didnrsquot really enjoy the interviewer i felt that he wasnrsquot paying attention to some of tonyrsquos responses and he was at times interrupting him however i looked up other videos about tony that i liked much more i will include the links at the bottom of my post in one of the videos i watched they gave a tour of the zappos headquarters which showed employees dressed up as superheros and pirates it also showed them spraying silly string at each other and racing remote control cars this is the type of corporate culture that tony wants to instill as it allows employees to take time to enjoy themselves and then get back to work nbsp after i took the penn university strengths test i was content with the results that i got i felt that the majority of it was pretty accurate i ranked high on the traits that i expected to rank high on i ranked the highest on community followed by vitality humor kindness spirituality creativity and then leadership i really enjoyed taking this strength test because it was short and not that consuming and i am always interested in seeing what my strengths are and how they are ordered nbsp  ,0,0,0,0,1,psu
2950,5015,zapposnbsp nbsp what makes the zappos corporate culture unique and successful is the worklife integration of personal values passion customer service and higher purpose with a vision the zappos employees place a crown on the customers and treat them like royalty and have employees greet them this makes zappos special in their mission statement of delivering happiness and being passionate about what they donbsp nbsp the three aspects that stood out the most were creating a culture of core values higher purpose and passion and personal connection creating a culture of core values intrigued me because it was a different perspective that was looked upon when starting a company many startups or entrepreneurs want to become financially successful in the market for what they are doing so for zappos to focus on personal values instead of being number  in the market is inspiring one thing that tony hsieh said was that ldquoone thing that separates great companies from others is that the great ones had a vision and higher purpose beyond money and profits in the market if there is a higher purpose the money follows and eventually become successfulrdquo this statement really spoke to me because nowadays itrsquos very hard to find a job that you are passionate for since we were brainwashed to get the highest paying salary from a job that we have no interest for besides wealth in turn this makes it difficult for people to obtain happiness hence the quote ldquomoney canrsquot buy happiness ldquofor tony to be able to create a culture of core values where passion is a priority rather than job performance is awesome the third aspect is the personal connection tony mentioned that he hated networking events because you would talk to a salesperson or recruiter for the sole reason of doing business or getting hired there is no personal connection established during the interaction the zappos culture is revolved around friendship as tony said after work the employees would hang out after work on weekends and spend time with each other for zappos the initial motivation is personal connection and friendship which is an aspect that many companies should integrate into the worklife environment as happiness leads to prosperitynbsp nbsp nbsp briefs strengths test nbsp the briefs strengths test from upennrsquos authentic happiness was very accurate in its results of describing my personality and behavior my results from this test were separated into  categories of frequencies such as always usually half the time occasionally and rarelynevernbsp nbsp fornbspalways it was humor playfulnessnbsp nbsp fornbspusually integrity authenticity honesty vitality zest enthusiasm vigor energy citizenship social responsibility loyalty teamwork fairness equality and justice forgivenessmercy ability to forgive persistence perseverance industriousness gratitude prudence caution and discretion and selfregulation selfcontrolnbsp nbsp fornbsphalf the time it was hope optimism futuremindedness future orientation humilitymodesty leadership intelligence social emotional personal learning curiosity interest noveltyseeking openness to experience bravery valor perspective wisdom kindness generosity nurturance care compassion and altruistic love ldquonicenessrdquonbsp nbsp fornbspoccasionally it was openmindedness judgement critical thinking love power to love and be loved and appreciation awe wonder elevationnbsp nbsp fornbsprarelynever it was spirituality religiousness faith purpose and creativity originality ingenuitynbsp nbsp after receiving my results i was impressed by the degree of accuracy and surprised to notice that the majority of the characteristics were realistic in the perspective of the  categories however for kindness i would say it would be in the usually category and creativity would be in the half the time categorynbsp nbsp my results relate to adaptability emotional intelligence grit community engagement initiative priority setting ethical judgment leadership problem solving and teamwork since i am persistent in achieving what i set out to do and can easily adapt with a flexible mindset the only skill that is not relatable would be risktaking since i am usually a safe and prudent depending on situations i like to be certain in my actions and decisions instead of playing a game with chance for this reason i tend to overthink a lot and try to minimize reckless actions although i do enjoy risks sometimes i prefer to analyze my options and develop a plan nbsp,1,0,0,0,1,psu
2951,5021,i think that zappos culture is unqiue and successful because of its approach towards customers and employees they treat customers and employees like they are family this treatment of customers and employees strengthens their overall relationships and drastically improves teamwork according to tony the customers come back not because of zappos prices but their customer service the three aspects from the video that stood out to me was the interview location the reiteration of employee culture and overall happiness the interview location stood out to me because most interviews are usually indoors in a somewhat isolated room instead they had the location on some stairs outside with random people passing by in the background tony brings up employee culture numerous times in the interview he talks about how zappos culture isnt exclusive to professionalism he emphasizes the importance of building friendships at zappos and how those personal relationships improve productivity in the workspace he also talks about the overall happiness of the employees he wants them to be happy doing their jobs and not regretting it years down the road nbsp in the brief strengths test my top strength was humilitymodesty ive been told numerous times by people that ive been too modest on my abilities in those cases i often find it very difficult to describe myself because we all have different perspectives on things when looking at my abilities i usually think im soso because i always see room for improvement even if i am good at something my other strengths included love citizenship integrity prudence curiousity and gratitude if i had to compare these results to the skills list i would compare them to emotional intelligence creative thinking and problem solving i thinknbspthat the more emotional strengths like love gratitude and humility align with emotional intelligence those kind of qualities have helped me identify the emotions of other people and myself my creative thinking would be aligned with curiosity i get curious about a lot of topics but i will say that my prudence gets in the way of that sometimes lastly problem solving would fit with my integrity prudence and curiousity my curiousity would drive me to look for every option while my prudence would keep me from making too many strange options my integrity would help me narrow down in my decision making since i would have to analyze each option to see if its actually possible,0,0,0,0,1,psu

2954,5023,i think what makes zappos corporate culture so unique is dedication to morals during the short video interview of tony hsieh zappos ceo it was very clear he is a man with solid morals three big things stuck out to me first was his clarity in what he wanted his company to be the second is that it wasnt to just be the biggest name in shoe retail but rather to offer the best customer service there is the third is that true success came when he shifted focus away from becoming number one and focused on what he was passionate about nbsp the results of my brief strength test are exactly what i expected i like that i am able to compare results to others that have taken the test but to be honest i dont understand these types of tests they do not make me feel reflective i understand how selfreporting on recent occasions still produces some accurate character traits but i dont feel like i have gained anything from the test your skill personality and moral high points and failings are a culmination of all your past experiencesnbspif tests dug into the highest and lowest points of peoples experience you be able to produce the same charts and answers from the brief strenths test and also have given the test takers an experience they can reflect on,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2956,5026,the zappos culture is so very unique and successful the reasons for this is because ceo tony hsieh actually cares about creating a company culture where values are recognized and appreciated tony highlights how his employees hangout with one another on weekends he speaks of creating a work and life that merge and intermingle i think this is something that stood out most to me because although people from work may hangout on the weekends the majority of people want the weekends to get away from work and keep their work life and personal life separate i think this is a forward concept for  because nowadays people are connected to work all the time through cell phones computers and even social media the next highlighted piece is how he talks about passion within his company tony wants workers who are passionate about the work they are doing it stood out to me when he talks about how although he couldnt pay his workers they stood by him because they were passionate about their work i think in todays world it can be difficult to find people who actually care about their work and are not just doing the job to pay the bills but its refreshing to know a company is actively looking for individuals that genuinely care about their work the last core value that stood out to me and one that i believe really makes him successful is his companies commitment to customer service he speaks about how zappos moved from just worrying about making money to actually focusing on customer satisfaction tony believes this concept translates into a better business and in turn will make money which makes investors and employees happy an idea around the integration of work and personal life the focus on hiring individuals who are so passionate about their work they would do it for free and a focus on customer service first are the main points that stuck out to me these are the ideas that make zappos the successful business it is today nbsp nbsp after completing the strengths test i definitely disagree with the results the first item that shocked me was the test said i usually am future oriented and optimistic this i disagree with because i am a very optimistic person and always hopeful about the future the next result was my level of appreciation i always appreciate the little things and believe this to be one of my good traits i believe the little things go a long way and should be a priority in a variety of situations lastly it says i am usually openminded i think i am very open minded i always enjoy hearing other ideas and ways to solve problems and i never ignore a suggestion i think i am a little disappointed in this test i do not believe that it accurately reflects me i am surprised nbsp my results relate heavily to the following vitality kindness citizenship fairness gratitude persistence learning humor perspective bravery nbsp usually hope appreciation humilitymodesty selfregulation intelligence openminded curiosity creativity love leadership nbsp half the time spirituality prudence integrity forgiveness nbsp,1,0,0,0,1,psu

2960,5027,  what makes the zappos corporate culture unique and successful   the zappos corporate culture is both unique and successful because the ceo tony hsieh created a work environment where the culture gets stronger as they grow he noted that he learned from his mistakes at his last company specifically in the hiring process tony hires and fires people based on how they follow their core values at zappos not just their work performance zappos really focuses on customer service now and being passionate about their work which adds to the unique and successful culture tony notes that a lot of the workers do not care all about the money and this makes them a lot more engaged in their work the customers would notice that the workers on the other end of the phone did not just care about the paychecks they really wanted to help the individual this kind of culture really shows the customers that the company cares which a lot of people care about when supporting an organization nbsp   talk about three aspects from the video that stood out to you the most why    one aspect from the video that really stood out to me was the fact that the conversation between tony and loic seemed very natural it did not seem as if tony was just talking about this kind of information to make zappos look better it seemed as if he genuinely meant everything that they were speaking about this goes to show that zappos really does care about the customer and the culture of the company which has caused them to grow into the large corporation that they are today nbsp another aspect from the video that stood out to me was the fact that zappos focusing on customer service really helped them get out of the situation that they were in when they were not doing well focusing on the customer was one of the core values that tony wanted to instill in his employees which really helped them get to where they are  nbsp one last aspect that stood out to me was when tony talked about how after work most zappos employees got together and hang out with each other on the weekends he said they would have barbeques and spend a lot of time with each other because of the fact that they share the same interests and values a quote by tony that interested me was when he said ldquoa lot of people talk about work life balance for us its really the work life integrationrdquo nbspnbsp then

2971,5022,as a millenial it is only natural that i love using social media until recently i had no idea this love for social media could be turned into a skill that could be turned into a job one of the projects i am working on for my surge internship is to help a client create an online and social media presence while i have never done research on social media i have found that me and my team members can quickly figure out what posts should look like to gain the most attention to me this is an exciting and interesting part of the internship so far i think it is a great challenege to take something i do on a daily basis like posting to instagram and learn the science behind what makes a post interesting and interactive i think it is really cool that i can take this knowledge to help this client grow her business but also be able to apply it my personal social media life as wellnbsp,1,0,0,0,1,psu

2974,5028,after a nice two weeks my expectations are holding up pretty well i now have a good feeling that i will gain a great experience by the end of this internship after collobrating with my team members and different teams i know that i can communicate and learn different stuffs from different teams with my team being on point we are able to get our parts of the projects done efficiently without any problems if we run into problems we know where we can go for help and thats our fellow coworkers we all can come together and brainstorm ideas to get a better solution to the problem we are trying to solve overall this internship will get me somewhere and i will definetly gain more knowledge to go out into the real worldnbsp,1,0,1,1,1,psu
2975,5017,nbspin the business world it is hard to say what to do drive you to success everyone has their own unique method but one thing that the ceo of zappos brings up was that happiness can make everyone successful whoever is an entrepreneur or an employee happiness makes thing become possible and easy because you love the things that you are doingnbsp nbsp nbspin the video where they talk about the core values those are the things that everyone who has a company or business should consider if they want to be successful in the long run i agree that the company should always have these four core elements so that they can keep their business expanded or going in the long run the second thing is the worklife balance that he mentioned right nowadays people need a worklife balance but they should do things like ceo of zappos said not just worklife balance but more like worklife integration coworkers can be friends or families of yours and you will more likely enjoy the work and succeed in your career the third thing is happiness it is important to be positive and happy because emotion is easy to spread out why not spread out our happiness instead of other emotions giving positive and strong emotion would much likely help each other live up their life and worknbsp nbsp nbspfor the result i dont have many surprises about it because i consider myself as a nice and honest person the top one is kindness however i am impressed by leadership being usually because i dont really know how to lead people but now i am willing to grow my leadershipnbsp,1,0,1,0,0,psu

2977,5025,like i talked about during the lunch exercise my first experiene with real failure was failing my drivers test i know that sounds stupid but before that i had never really failed at anything before when i was a kid and a teenager i was always a type a perfectionist i was constantly stressed and worried but at least i succeeded at everything i attempted then when i failed my drivers test i literally cried the whole way home about a  minute drive i was devastated and felt like it was the end of the world but then a week later i retook it and easily got my license that was a major turning point in my life since then i have learned that failures are not the end all be all quite often failure leads to something better for example i ran for two executive board positions for two different clubs this semester and didnt get either of them i was a bit bummed but i knew that these failures were going to help me learn and lead me to much better things then i was able to start my own club that i am very passionate about and became a ta for my favorite subject without my initial failures i would have not even attempted my now successes thanks to what may sound like a minimal setback i have learned so much more than any success wouldve ever taught me i included a picture of when i finally did get my licensenbsp,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2978,5018,when i think of the different times i experienced failure there is one specific moment that pops into my head during my freshman year of high school i tried out for a club soccer team that i had my eye on for a while the tryouts were spread across  different weekends so i had multiple chances to prove myself on the soccer field i knew this was one of the best clubs to play for so i didnrsquot get my hopes up but i felt confident in my chances at the end of the  weekends i felt good about how i played during the tryouts and left with my head held high a few weeks later i received an email thanking me for taking the time to try out for their club but i would not be receiving an offer  nbsp this experience frustrated me but it motivated me to work even harder i ended up staying with the club team i had previously played for but would use days where we didnrsquot have practice to train by myself or with my brother i learned that while you think you may be working hard there is always room for improvement when it comes to training i improved not only my skill set but i learned how to push myself further than ever before  nbsp while i never ended up trying out for that specific club team again the team i stayed with had a successful season and made a deep playoff run i believe that this entire process helped me grow as not only a soccer player but as a human too it allowed me to view the game from a different perspective and see the positives from a negative outcome,0,0,1,0,0,psu
2979,5017,as the old saying says failure is the mother of success there is no one can do one thing perfectly and successfully without a try people experienced failure so many times small or big and the biggest failure i had is the test that i took back in my middle school it was the second big test in china the first one is for high school students same as uss sat we have to take tests to get into famous and topnbsphigh school that we want we have a mockup test before the real test i did pretty well reach my expectation on the mockup however i failed to reach the score that i wanted and i didnt get into one of the top middle schools i learned that i should study harder and study smart because i wasnt good at math and english and i didntnbspput enough effort into doing the assignment and extra assignmentnbsp time is very important especially for young people like the saying says the time is money i learned that as long as we spend time on something we will earn a solid result without the test failure i wouldnt realize that i need to study harder and harder on english and made todays me now i would say my english is two times better than me at middle school this failure definitely plays an important lead to my success in my lifenbspnbsp,0,1,1,0,0,psu

3002,5018,i would say that one of the biggest risks of my life came when i was a senior in high school my rec league basketball team was making our way through the playoffs which was a surprise since we were slightly above average during the regular season we lacked players in the semifinals which forced us to play without any substitutes against the second best team in the league once we won that game we started to realize that we really had a chance to win it all  nbsp during the championship game we went in with a full roster and were leading by as many as  points in the first half however something happened in the second half that none of us were expecting it seemed as if our entire team forgot how to play basketball and before we knew it the lead was cut to  points and then  points and then the next time i looked at the scoreboard it was tied with  minutes remaining we battled back and forth and ended up going into overtime this is where my biggest risk came in overtime of the championship game there was  seconds on the clock and we were down by  points our coach called a timeout and we started to draw up a play i stepped in and recommended that we should attempt an inbound play that we had only used in practice it involved a series of complex screens and off ball movement from the entire team and ended with the ball in my hands shooting a  point shot on the right side of the court i knew this would be a risky attempt since we had never used it in a game before but we decided to follow through with it we inbounded the ball and everything flowed perfectly i caught the ball while one of my teammates made sure i had a clear shot the entire play happened so fast that next thing i knew i was being jumped on by my teammates my shot went in and we had won the championship and i realized that my risky decision had actually payed off  nbsp when i was younger there had been times during my soccer and basketball career that i passed up on taking the game winning shot or stepping in for a crucial penalty kick i always felt that if i missed a shot that ended up costing us a game that i would be seen as a failure i had been content with being a solid player but could never build up the courage to have the outcome of a single game in my hands i am glad that i finally was confident enough to have my teammates trust me to make a shot in such an important game i think that this helped me grow a lot as a person and as an athlete because i knew that even if i had missed that shot my teammates would have had my back nbsp,0,0,0,1,1,psu

3018,5025,although i had a ton of fun on friday it was a little frustrating in the escape room i thought i would do a lot better than i actually did everyone in my group was able to bring up such good points and come up with different ways to decipher the clues when i told my parents and friends about the experience i jokingly kept saying the escape room made me realize how dumb i am but it was kind of true i thought i would be able to perform a lot better than i actually did although i know realistically that this is not an accurate representation of my intelligence i think that it just compounded with other things i have been feeling lately to ultimately make me feel inferior as i waited a couple of days to think about things i still felt this nagging feeling of insecurity hopefully this week i can gain some of that backnbsp however i still had a lot of fun and i was really impressed with some of the people in my group it surprised me how a couple of people who i didnt expect to do so took the lead right away and did so well nbsp,0,1,0,0,1,psu
3019,5018,i think that the axe throwing and the escape room activities were a great team building activity i felt that the escape room was a perfect opportunity for us to work as a team and communicate with each other the theme of the escape room was also really interesting the theme of my groups room was biohazard and we had to unlock different things such as lockers and safes i enjoyed the way they made the theme interactive by making us wear lab coats and protective glasses i found that during the process we were not only having conversations about how to get out of the room but we were having unrelated side conversations as well obviously if you lock people in a room together they will eventually start to converse but this was a good experience that we could talk about after it was over the axe throwing was also fun activity that also integrated teamwork and communication during the axe throwing we were able to get into teams and compete against the other groups which made the activity a lot more fun nbsp i really think that these type of activities are more beneficial than something like the snack activity we did i feel that if you give people an experience they can talk about even after it is over they will be able to get more out of it both the escape room and the axe throwing were great experiences where we all shared great conversations and endless laughs ,0,1,0,1,1,psu
3020,5021,on friday we went to iq escape where we did some axethrowing and successfully made our way out of escape rooms we were split into teams of roughly  people to escape our designated room in my escape room we had to steal the mona lisa and replace it with a fake it took us about  puzzling minutes to escape the room after that we did some axethrowing with some trivia mixed into it i would say that our teamwork communication work ethic grit and risk taking were significant to our success with the escape room our success was highly dependent on our ability to cooperate and collaborate with each other in completely differeny ways we had to communicate effectively enough to come up better approaches for each room which made us take more risks in order to solve each puzzle in order to keep us from giving up we had to have high work ethic and intense grit nbsp recording ,1,1,0,1,1,psu
3021,5030,we had team building activities last friday with an escape room and axe throwing these two activities are really interesting and helpful in the escape room game i found that team thinking and working are more efficient than one person we play a game about stealing the mona lisa and replacing a fake one during the game we need to work as a team to figure out the clues and how to use these clues to the next step in our team everyone had their ideas and we tried them to figure these ideas when someone had an idea and immediately our teammates would try through our teamwork and teamthinking we finally finish this game and became a better team axe throwing is a game about technique i can not do it until i watched my teammate throwing and learned how he can make it this process tells me that you can always learn from others even the people around you,0,1,0,1,1,psu

3025,5023,my hardest ethical decision came from my past job as a maintenance tech at the apartment complex where i worked we had a  person crew for about  bedrooms it was a pretty big place so it was budgeted an understandably large sum the shop we had was large so we stored thousands of dollars worth of material in it mostly common replacement items like doors furniture plumbing parts etc it was about  months into where i started working when i noticed that our work order reports clearly did not match our onhand inventory like i mentioned before the place was big so it was common for my coworkers and i not to work right next to each other however all i had to do was watch for about a half hour and i saw my coworker come take a door without filling out a work order he went and installed it in an apartment right next to the shop and pocketed cash from the kids i get that he might have just been trying to help the kids out by charging them less than the company would have i know that he could have just been struggling and needed the extra cash i still couldnt just let it go you have to understand that your not just stealing from a big company who has the money to spare your stealing from your coworkers we work together everyday to make sure the company does well so in turn we can make a living and support ourselves and our families what he did put me at risk directly and indirectly directly because anyone could have watched the numbers and placed blame on any one of the three maintenance men indirectly because imagine if just a few more people had his same ideals budgets are skyrocketing but repair incomes are down one of your highest margins for profit is wiped out if the company hurts so does its employees i confronted my coworker about it and tried to explain this to him he didnt take that very well especially me being  years younger than him i told him if he needed extra money that i could help him out any way i could after a lengthy conversation it became clear his motives were nothing of neccessity but of greed the way he spoke about the company for the next half hour made it an easy choice to tell him to either come clean to our supervisor or leave i no longer wanted to work next to himnbspi hated having to do it but of course he did not do either of those things so i had to come clean to the supervisor i hate to see anyone lose their job but i wont sit and let you endanger other peoples livelihoods to better your own,0,0,0,0,0,psu
3026,5027,escape room and axe throwing on friday was a very cool experience i had never done either so this was very new and interesting to me during the escape room we had to use a lot of teamwork and communication to make sure that we were thinking about how to solve the puzzle we ended up getting out of the room in about an hour and ten minutes we had to ask for some clues but we did a very good job working together to reach a common goal also we had to take a lot of risks basically trying to brute force the passwords and codes for the safe computers and locker i feel this is a very good way to boost our teamwork skills by having us use our various skill sets to help each other out nbsp axe throwing was also a very interesting experience and it was always something that i wanted to try i have seen a lot of my friends post the experience on their social media accounts and i always wondered how hard it was making sure you get the form down was key to having the axe stick into the board i feel that work ethic and failure related to this because you had to work on your form if you wanted to be successful having a bad throw just meant that you had to get the axe and throw again working on your form and how hard you threw it i realized that the form mattered more than the power while throwing it and i worked on this throughout my time axe throwing nbsp for our overall surge business development internship teamwork communication work ethic failuregrit and risk taking are topics that we need to be comfortable with being able to help someone on a task that their not very familiar with is key to being a team player also having the skill sets to communicate with one another is also important when working in this setting keeping your time management and making sure you work hard during your time here is also key to success it is important that if you fail you do not give up but use it as a learning experience finally making sure you take some risks when completing work can be helpful to a certain extent one must find the correct amount of risk to take and if you do not succeed use it as a learning experience,0,0,0,1,1,psu
3027,5027,i had been working at my job as a line cook for three years at this point i was pretty much the second in charge in the kitchen and there were some days that i would have to take over if the kitchen manager was not present being that i was young and friendly with all of the workers some of the other staff tried to take advantage of me when my manager was not present at work they would ask for extra meals try to use their phones more and do things that they knew they were not supposed to be i know that something needed to be done because the rules set in place by the board of members and the general management needed to be followed if there was no structure and formalities the employees would do whatever they wanted to  i had to do something but i also did not want to be labeled as a whistleblower in the kitchen so i thought of some ways to try and stop these ethical dilemmas from happening at first i would tell them no if they tried to ask for more food and i would try to keep them focused by informing them of work that needed to be done this did not work very well because they were all around my age and did not want to listen to someone unless they were an elder some of the employees listened however not all of them so i thought what could i do to incentivise them to conduct their work  nbsp i came up with the solution of sitting the manager of my kitchen down i told him that i did not want them to be reprimanded for their actions but i wanted them to work hard even when he was not there together we decided that we would have a kitchen meeting my manager and i both spoke our feelings and noted that no one was in trouble but that they needed to be respectful of the rules that are set in place this ended up resonating with the staff because from that point on they worked hard and did not try to take advantage of when the head manager was not present ,0,1,0,0,0,psu

3038,5025,if i were to be asked this question in an interview i think i would be a little stumped at first but luckily for me now ive had some time to think about what i would answer my answer would probably look something like this when i was a sophomore in highschool i went to puerto rico with my spanish travel club one night while in old san juan my friends and i were watching a street peformer act out famous poetry we were enjoying our time when i suddenly saw a disheveled looking woman sneak behind the performer and take something from his bag i was stunned i pointed it out to my friends and asked did you see that they told me to just let it go but i couldnt i ran after the woman and asked her if she took something from him she frantically explained in spanish that she was a friend of his and was just borrowing something i was skeptical but she seemed to be so panicked that i wondered if there were more to the story i walked back to my friends and they insisted we leave to meet the rest of our group but i couldnt i stayed until the performer was done and then approached him and explained what i had saw he laughed and said shes a friend of mine shes suffering from some mental issues currently its no worries what she took from me i ended up feeling extremely embarassed how could i have just assumed the worst of people that way but then again what if she had been stealing from him in the end i was glad i ran after her i think that if you see some sort of injustice you become part of the problem by being a bystander but this situation also taught me that you never know what someones story may be so you must be kind to everyone,0,0,0,0,0,psu

3085,5021,i lovenbsplisteningnbspto music when i need to focus on a task at hand and it provides me with the ultimate distraction in a work environment music distracts me from nearly everything it also acts as a mental filter that can reduce the amount of random thoughts i get earlier this week i took a small risk by listening to something outside my usual tastes there wasnt a lot of work to be done since my groups were waiting to hear back from our clients so i decided to switch things up with my music especially since there wasnt that much to focus on if anything i needed something to relax my tension from focusing so much i browsed through the new releases on spotify and i chose tyler the creator and lil nas x surprisingly i liked some of the albums that they put out i think i liked it because the overall ambience they provided with their compositions i think that i have also become a little more accustomed to some of the more modern music trends because of how often they are played in public frankly i wouldnt mind exploring more of that kind of music in my free time,0,0,1,0,0,psu
3086,5023,for this week we were to gonbsp out and find a new experience that we could do on our own i had class in the borland building a few times over the course of my penn state career they always have an art exhibit filling a significant portion of the downstairs and yet never once did i stop and go to it im not much one for art our palmer museum trip was the first art exhibit ive really ever participated in ive kinda always wanted to see one of the exhibits in borland so i decided to walk over yesterday i didnt really even check to see what was going to be in there but thankfully they did have a room on display it was mostly relief sculptures and very very old figurines i thought it was so coincidental that these are what was on display because they are from the same period as the art i had to study for one of my classes in borland some ancient art history class i hated it thats why i wanted to come see an exhibit by myself because i feel that maybe if i wasnt always forced to learn about art i would enjoy it more i definitely can pay attention much more in an art exhibit then i can an art classroom but i still felt unenthused i thought id like it better than going to the palmerton which i did actually enjoy i dont know i guess i appreciate the chance to calmly look around and take everything in formulate my own ideas about the art free from others influence but i still found myself thinking i would much rather have someone there to share the experience with,0,0,0,0,0,psu
3087,5028,something new i tried this week by myself was to make chicken curry i never ever tried to cook anything but last weekend i was hungry and did not feel like going out to eat like i usually do so i decided to just stay in the house and cook i had all the ingredients i needed because my mom brought me everything incase i decide to try to give cooking a try although i didnt know the order of what to put i just tried to remember how my mom cooks it one time i was near her learning how to cook but never was interested so didnt pay attention too much after i was finished i took a look at the pot and it didnt look like the color its supposed to look like i think i mightve forgotten something but i took a little taste of it and it was nowhere near delicious i made a mess in my kitchen and couldnt eat what i made so leaving me with no choice i just went out and ate such a fail probably wont cook again,0,0,0,0,0,psu
3088,5022,this summer i decided that it would be the perfect time to try something new now that i am actually living on my own i get to do many things that i otherwise would not have had the chance to do otherwise one of these things is cooking i have always loved cooking but up until now i have never done it on my own either my friends or family are cooking with me or we decide to just eat out for this prompt i decided to try something new and cook on my ownnbsp in order to startup this experience i decided to subscribe to hellofresh a company who sends you  meals a week and all the ingredients needed for these meals this saved me a lot of time from figuring out reciepies and going grocery shopping being able to cook meals on my own was a really cool experience it was actually a very relaxing way to end my day i was able to blast my music and take me time cooking rather than having to cooperate with another person in the kitchen i got the chance to make an amazing mushroom ravioli and tostadas these are recipies that i will continue to make even after this summer this experience allowed me to not only do something that i have wanted to do for a long time but also branch out and learn new recipiesnbsp,1,0,0,0,0,psu

3100,5018,music has been something i have been interested in my entire life i can remember being in kindergarten and listening to pearl jam and led zeppelin with my dad while i did my homework i was too young to really sit down and listen to the lyrics and comprehend what message was being portrayed so i basically listened to anything my dad put on around the time i got to middle school i started to form my own opinion on what kind of music i preferred to listen to i still listen to pearl jam and led zeppelin to this day but i have become attracted to hiphoprap more than any other genre the main thing i enjoy about hiphop and rap music is that it has a great amount of versatility among its artists based on the artists hometown they usually use different styles when rapping which in turn led to the creation of a few regional genres within the overall hiphoprap genre  whenever im not sleeping or hanging out with friends i more than likely have my earbuds in listening to some sort of music whether im walking to class doing homework or even just relaxing music helps clear my mind if i am having a rough day i try to put on songs that are more upbeat in tempo or remind me of a great experience ive had i think its interesting that a single song can be related to a certain point in your life or even bring up a specific memory no matter what music will be around to put you in a great mood or make an already great time even better,1,0,0,0,0,psu

3122,5041,teamwork has always been an essential component to success this idea has repeatedly occurred throughout my life since an early age my various amount of coaches on the sports teams i played for never failed to stress the importance of teamwork and how it is integral to winning yet teamwork is much more significant than just the simple idea of the difference between winning or losing a game while maturing and growing up i realized that teamwork is necessary for almost all aspects of life companies families government and much more all need assistance from others to reach their goals teamwork allows for greater creativity among others as it allows ideas to be created from one another also teamwork grants less workload and stress on one independent person furthermore a team can help one another when need be so each person can reach their full potential all of these aspects of teamwork have been crucial toward the success of my experiences for example last year i was elected as the multicultural greek council mgc delegate for the university park undergraduate association upua here i was able to take part in and witness an amazing amount of teamwork within the organization one particular instance in which teamwork was critical was the establishment of community seats within upua for several years the black caucus latino caucus and the asianpacific american caucus within penn state have been fighting for more diversity within upua and wanted representation their fight for representation reached a high tension between the caucuses and upua last year and made several students within and out of upua take action first there was constant communication between people about the creation of a piece of legislation that would create the new chairs in upua this piece of legislation would have to get passed in the governmental affairs committee in order for it to have a chance to be voted on in upua wording or possible weaknesses of the legislation were carefully discussed we also had to find people interested in wanting to endorse the legislation that was in the governmental affairs committee which luckily i was a member of it was also integral for me to talk to the students within the mgc to try and get as many voices as possible to encourage the importance of more diversity within upua as well as keep them updated on any ongoing process regarding the situation after much editing on the document and a constant stream of students inside and outside upua discussing their passion about the establishment of the new chairs in upua the piece of legislation eventually reached upua to be voted on in which it was passed that night will always hold special significance for myself and others the smiles and cheers of those who worked on the document and those who were there at the meeting waiting on the verdict made everyones hard work seem worth it now starting this upcoming year the caucuses will finally have their rightful representation all due to a great amount of teamwork ,0,0,0,1,0,psu

3177,5041,while touring the palmer museum of art i ended up choosing a piece of artwork named ldquoleaving townrdquonbsp this art piece was a painting of a small town with a long thin road going down it it was painted from the perspective as if a car might have been traveling on the townrsquos road but a passenger was looking out the rear window of the car leaving town due to that perspective of the painting and the title of the artwork i believe the artwork contains a somber tone however the artwork also contains a positive and colorful tone to it as well the artwork does not have much shading to it but instead uses one full color to detail its pieces the colors used are bright and somewhat give off a cartoony vibe nbsp when i first viewed the artwork i was taken back to my childhood even though the town i grew up in did not look like the town that was pictured in the painting i believe it was the dreaminess of the painting that reminded me of my childhood when i think about my childhood memories i usually picture them in a colorful dreamy atmosphere which the painting evoked also the color palette reminded me of some of the cartoons i watched and some video games i played as a child too in addition i have not returned to my childhood town since i left so when i picture it i think back on it almost in the same aesthetic as the painting and providing it a calm atmosphere similar to the paintingnbsp nbsp i believe the artist might have been full of nostalgia while painting the artist was probably picturing a town that they were away from but yearning to return to while creating the painting there is also the chance that the artist was feeling bittersweet the artist might have been full of joy while remembering a specific town but also a bit sad that they werenrsquot able to return for some reason overall i believe the feelings the artist might of felt while painting was felt by those who looked at it nbsp disclaimer picture used is not the painting leaving town ,1,0,0,0,0,psu

3351,5435,one of my favorite quotes about art is one by cesar a cruz art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable while creating art i tend to think of this quote i do not make art to capture the likeness alone of things nor to convey some hyperspecific idea i may start at said idea but along the way purposefully add layers of meanings to ensure that there will be multiple interpretations the themes i often deal with include affairs of the mind and distressing aspects of society even in pieces made with the intention of being more of a study than anything else there is this ghostly quality to them with their smooth gradients and often soft lines and i find that these pieces can sometimes evoke feelings of dread or wariness  this is purposeful what we express into society is filtered by what we percieve as valid to expressbut when we look inside the mind there is no such censorship only the raw daunting realities of whatever may plague us or have our interests to me these rather surreal works have far more authenticity than they would have if being completely fitting to what we would see in our world an artist i admire zdzislaw bekinski said i wish to paint in such a manner as if i were photographing dreams and i do as well i connect with him because i too do not want to portray total realism but the concerning gray area between that and cartoonism like bekinski i have an interest in showcasing the darker parts of life in my artwork as i feel that has a deepness that can lead to revelations,1,1,1,1,0,pva

3503,5357,accomplishment  an accomplishment i would say is really important to me is learning how to program programming for me is sort of how i managed to learn more about how computer operate it introduced me to the multiple syntaxs and termnology of programing learning to program set up the basic foundations of expanding my knowlage towards programming in multiple languages such as lua python and c although mostly starting with a hello world program in c since i have first programmed a hello world program i have learned to calculate numbers in the computer with varibles and constants later on i then learned about functions and decission makeing which allowed for more complex programs and without learning programing i probably would know less about how software and computers work learning to program is an acomplishment although i now know how to program what specific event that lead to this accomplishment was when i took a class called intro to computer programming in  grade this class was the class where i wrote a hello world program in c the class started out with understanding the basics of a computer looking at what parts a computer has of coarse it then tought me the importance of writeing down a solution before actually writeing code i learned about puesudue code which is writeing down directions on how to get to the solution of coarse i also learned about diagrams that can be used to figure out the solution on what a person would like the computer to do then afterwords it would be onto the programing mostly the class followed along with example programs that would usally take the entire class to complete as their was explain what each syntax and convention ment and how they worked althought it was very basic information it was enough to learn how to program on my own as i had the foundation of programming basics in c visual basic and java and to this day i consider learning to program as one of my greatest acomplishments in summary learning to program was a steping stone for me as an introduction to computing in general in the future it will help with my own career and will be one of the most usefull things in my life this acomplishment has made me greatfull that i had taken the class to beable to do things at the tips of my fingers as programming is fun without this acomplishment i would not be sure what i would be doing without it nbsp accomplishment  besides programming anther accomplishment is learning how to paint right after the  grade i was put into a painting i class which tought painting before i could not actually paint really well and barly knew how to paint because i had only worked with water colors before but they where not that great of water colors so in this class i had learned all about the techniques used in painting then for the second half i was able to paint what i would have like to paint as required projects here i really practiced my painting skills on what works and does not work the first time around in the class we started with water colors and the first water color in that class i did was the twin towers because it was in september and the anversary of  was right around the corner of coarse we did multiple other watercolors but then we started working with acrylic which is a type of paint that i wanted to try out because it was much thicker and could be layered unlike the water color acrylic would be the bases of all my projects for the second half the projects i did paint was a landscape of the moon the sea a cityscape unironicly squidward from the spongebob tv show that i watch a long time ago ect basicly it really introduced a new scope of things to me for painting as i found painting to be more enjoyable without that class i probabl would have not found that painting is really enjoyable i am thankful that i even took that class to begin with mostly painting for me now is something that is very intresting by slaping paint on a canvas to create an image although not actually slaping painting on a canvas but rather applying paint in summary also learning to propperly paint is an acomplishment as it tought me to paint and to paint well nbsp accomplishment  anthor accomplishment that would most likely happen this year is graduateing for a long time i have been going to school and for a long time i have wanted to go out in the world and work in a career job getting a high school diploma will be a stepping stone and a big accomplishment for moveing forward in life as i will beable to go get a bachlors degree in computer science and hopefully move onto beging a game developer how i managed to get to this point is by going to school everyday and getting good grades in school mostly these things are the ways i can succeed in school to graduate i have mostly done this in high school but in elementry school i barely strived for much as i just went to school and that was pretty much it i also had some other stuff happen in my life while the time i was in school i also have been held back a year because i was put in school too early to sum it up it was really just a long journey with ups and downs but i am on the road to acheiveing this accomplishment after many years nbspin conclusion graduating will be a major acomplishment and will be a major one continueing forward in life it has been a long journy with many other acomplishments in between i have met many people over the years and done so manythings over the years that all my work in school would pay off by the time go getting a diploma yet again i am also

3745,5358,for my senior year of high school i had the opportunity during the second nine weeks of the year to intern with fourth grade special education and third grade special education this gave me the opportunity to talk and educate the students communicate with their teacher and this also involved me in communicating to my supervisor as well during this internship i was creating lesson plans and with one of my lesson plans their teacher observed me teaching like their boss our principal or superintendent would do with them she then gave me critiques on my lesson plan and how i was executing my lesson plan to the students communicating with their teacher after the lesson allowed me to better my soft skill of communication this will help me communicate to the students in a more clear fashion which is important to their education the soft skill of communication also allows relationships to be built and the information for a project or in a workplace can be executed clearly  currently i am interning with first and second grade with these classes i am almost like a teacherrsquos aid and i help in the classroom with what the teachers need the most whether it is working with smaller groups a couple students at a time or work with students one on one and help them get caught up with their work having this opportunity to work with younger children has given me the opportunity to see if i wanted to pursue a career in early childhood education or possibly special education i have also developed the skill of communicating with the studentrsquos teachers and the students themselves on a deeper understanding even though the students are not far from age from each other from first to fourth grade the way that i communicate by just talking to the students is different which is important to know how to do,0,0,0,1,1,pva

4802,5281,through the penns valley football team i have gained a strong skill of teamwork i have been able to build strong relationships with the players and the staff i also dont think it matters what grade i was in i always felt apart of the team and made sure that i kept my relationships strong by completing my responsibilities to the best of my abilities this leads to supporting my friends on the team when they do something or good or make sure that they just push away any bad thoughts if they have made a mistake if i am in the weight room and i am pushing myself with high weight my strength and training coach and teammates will be there to support me to push me through the pain to overcome this feat the team throughout my years of playing has become a family to me and the teamwork represented through everyone can be used in future life this experience will allow me to and has allowed me to gain relationships in my internship i also strive to get my work done on time and to the best of my abilities just like the football field,0,0,0,0,1,pva

4805,5281,for my senior year of high school i have worked as an intern at johnson brothers accounting i have done multiple things throughout this internship for the first half of the school year i had learned the basics of payroll general ledger scanning and also learned how taxes work for the second half of the year i am mainly doing payroll one day and general ledger for the rest of the week unless i am told otherwise i have learned my place in the work is to complete any work that can be completed for my work to be accepted my payroll sheets have to be looked over by two people to ensure i am sending out the correct information also my work in general ledger has to be checked over by one person then sent to the boss who looks over it then sends it back to me to be completed and send out any more documents that are requested the process for one account to receive their checkbook information requires everyone in the office to complete their assignments it starts with payroll completing the checkbooks and telling them what taxes they need to pay then it would be checked over by a tax officer to make sure the tax information is onehundred percent correct then an account sends in their own checkbooks and possibly a bank statement which most accounts have to be reconciled after the reconciliation the accounts transactions basically need to be checked to see if they are logical when then were put into the system during the reconciliation but once the boss checks it over it gets sent back for any more documents then sent out to the client for them to receive their updated checkbook balance previously it took me the whole hour i had to complete maybe one or two very small accounts in payroll but now i have more time and i am able to complete as many accounts they need me to do in one day the same thing can be said about the general ledger work but since this process takes more information to complete an account it still takes me one or two days for one account to be completed but now i can plug in all thenbspchecks and deposits the account has done in less than one day this is my understanding of the workplace through an accounting internship,0,0,1,0,0,pva
